## NPCs


### King Kaius III



1. There are rumors about K3 actually being K1 as an immortal vampire. However, there is plenty of evidence such as K3 stand in sunlight, bleeding, reflections, etc. to prove he is not K1 as a vampire
2. However, K3 is actually K3 posing as K1 pretending to be K3. To his inner circle (who he knows is controlled by Erandis Vol/Lady Illmarrow), he poses as K1 with the help of his lover’s, Etrigani, magic to give him the properties of an undead.
    1. K3 does this so that Erandis Vol and her minions still believe she is in control of K1 and thus Karrnath.
    2. To the public, he acts as normal K3
3. K1 actually approached K3 before K3 took the throne letting him know that Erandis has control over him. Not wanting to jeopardize the peace of Karrnath and refusing to be anyone’s puppet, K1 asked K3 to pose as him to his inner circle so that Erandis can be content and Karrnath live in peace under the true K3
    3. K1 told K3 to banish him to Dreadhold, making it look like K1 banished the real K3 in order to rule Karrnath.
    4. K3 agreed with this course of action and works hard to hold Erandis at bay and find a way to break the spell on his grandfather.


### King Kaius I/Prisoner Deep Fourteen

1. Use Vampire Warrior stats
2. K1 currently lives in Dreadhold as a prisoner pulling a double bluff on Erandis Vol, who controls him. He is in a magically sealed iron mask and shackles that prevents detection, speaking, and any movement above a slow walk. He isn’t allowed anything to write with either.
    1. Only K3 knows his true identity, and the Warden believes he is actually K3.
    2. All of this is done to prevent Erandis from controlling him and is fooled into thinking his grandson is actually him, as his grandson looks for a way to free him from Erandis’s control so that they can rid her and the Emerald Claw from Karrnath.
3. To the few that know of Prisoner Deep Fourteen, even fewer know of his purposefully faked identity, and even fewer still know of his true identity.


### Etrigani

1. 
K3’s lover and undercover Dreadhold agent


2. 
She is the only means of communication between K1 and K3


3. 
Etrigani is the creator of the spell, _Undead Attributes_ that allows her lover, K3 appear as a vampire before Erandis’s court.


4. 
Etrigani, K3, and K1 are all working together to free K1 of his vampiric fealty to Erandis and overthrow her

### Drago Thul

1. 
A Karrnathi warlord that challenges the legitimacy of K3’s identity. He believes that K3 is actually vampiric K1 (which is what K3 is trying to do).


2. 
After being met with very strong evidence that proves K3 is not K1, Drago refused to accept it and now plots how to overthrow him with a band of mercenaries in Stormreach, Xen’drik
