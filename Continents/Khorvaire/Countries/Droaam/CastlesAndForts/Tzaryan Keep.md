[[Droaam]]
1. **Type:** Castle/Fort

The warlord, Tzaryan Rrac resides here.

 A cunning oni with a large force of ogres and orcs at his disposal, Tzaryan Rrac was quick to embrace the arrival of the hags, but he also yearns for greater power. Rrac is a skilled alchemist and a scholar of arcane lore.

 Most of his subjects are orcs, grouped in several tribes and lorded over by Rrac's ogre followers. He also claims lordship over a number of the Watching Wood's dark fey, as well as a group of gnolls and trolls.
