[[Droaam]]
1. **Type:** Castle/Fort

a massive tower close to Droaam's western border, and the residence of [[Mordain the Fleshweaver]] the Fleshweaver. It reaches high up into the sky, and is shaped somewhat like a malformed limb, seemingly made out of the flesh of a black dragon. The walls bleed when struck, but the tower's wounds heal extraordinarily fast. Gruesome flesh-golems and malformed creatures (the results of Mordain's experiments) patrol around the hall. The tower has been magically protected against scrying and teleportation by Mordain.
