[[Droaam]]
1. **Type:** Nature

Long ago, Mordain released skinweavers into the woods surrounding his tower. These strange creatures weave webs using their victims entrails, skin and other assorted body parts, thus making it a monstrous place which the gnolls call Kresht Rhyll, the forest of flesh. They are not the only strange creatures living here, and any possible combination of twisted, bestial creatures grafted together may dwell in these woods, alongside even stranger beings such as aberrant dryads. Most of these creatures have had their instincts, dietary needs or reproductive cycles changed in order to be able to fit so many predators in so small an area. Some known creations of Mordain that live here include:
- Bloodweb spiders
- Hydra with medusa heads
- Insane elementals
- Rot scarabs
- Skinless wolves
- Skinweavers
- Troll with the voice and wings of a harpy
- Tryll

Due to Mordain's power the forest is thick and lush, with a strange combination of flora that cannot be found elsewhere. Several of the plants inside of the forest are subterranean in nature. Examples include:
- Banshee Boughs
	- A tree that howls in agony whenever it is disturbed in any way
- Bloodvines
	- A vine that produces human blood instead of sap
- Ghoul's Rose
	- A type of flowering plant that secretes a pungent smell of rotting corpses to attract flies
- Phosphorescent fungi
	- Fungi that often creates paths through the forest
- Stormflower
	- Flowers capable of emitting an electrical discharge to protect themselves. This jolt can be deadly for smaller creatures, and even humanoids can easily be killed by a patch of stormflowers zapping them all at once.
