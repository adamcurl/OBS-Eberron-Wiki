1. **Type:** Ruins

The Fallen Demesne is the ruins of an old Phiarlan tower before the Mark of the Shadow even came to be. It was concealed during the reign of the Dhakaani Empire and served as a proxy base for the elves.

The tower was made by magewrights that doubles as agents of the Aerenal elves back then. It was naked to the eyes of those who lacked the arcane abilities. House Phiarlan wasn't a dragonmark house nor a properly acknowledge group at the time, but these group of spies and assassins were without a doubt competent at what they do. They practiced the art of shadow magic here and began the studies of the Five Demesne.

None of the Dhakaani ever discovered this place. Any hobgoblins or goblins that found it were effectively removed or brainwashed. When the Daelkyr invaded however, it was found due to their powerful magic and destroyed the tower by twisting it with their maddening magic. They also made the ground cave in and bury the tower in a large hole.
