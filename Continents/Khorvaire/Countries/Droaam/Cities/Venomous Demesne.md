[[Droaam]]
1. **Type:** City

A city-state hidden on the far side of Droaam in the desolate marshes south of Blackwater Lake, shrouded by powerful magic — is populated by tieflings. These tieflings descend from Sarlonan mages who bargained with dark powers, with the Demesne’s lords being powerful warlocks and wizards. The Venomous Demesne has had no significant contact with the Five Nations and few know it exists.

The Venomous Demesne lies in the west of Droaam, hidden by powerful illusions. It was founded by tiefling refugees from the ancient Sarlonan kingdom of Ohr Kaluun, and its four ruling families possess great knowledge and vast arcane power. Tiefling wizards and warlocks can be found serving as Katra’s Voice or Teraza’s Eye. The people of the Venomous Demesne— including a significant human population—look down on both the inhabitants of Droaam and the Five Nations, but they value their alliance with the Daughters of Sora Kell and are willing to suffer some indignities for this cause.

Warlord Bal Molesh is a strong ally of the Daughters, and some of his tiefling kin can be found in the service of Daask.

## Timeline
**-1,600:** In Sarlona, the Sundering begins. Over the next two hundred years, the quori use manipulation and greed to stir up riots and wars across the continent. These conflicts lead to a wave of human refugees settling on Khorvaire, notably in the Shadow Marches and the Demon Wastes. Tiefling and human refugees from Sarlona establish the Venomous Demesne in what is now Droaam.

**985 YK:** Sora Teraza approached the lords of the Venomous Demesne.

## Four Noble Families
### House Xarmir
House Xarmir is a warlock household that forms pacts with the daelkyr. Thanks to the alien knowledge gifted to this house, the Venomous Demesne has been able to advance and excell in magic.

However, this house is actually entirely made up of Inspired that serve the Dreaming Dark. As the 4 noble families fled Sarlona from the ever-encroaching Riedra kingdom, the Dreaming Dark was still able to infultrate them. For the last 2,500 years, the family of Inspired tieflings has layed low and played their game carefully. The family still makes pacts with the daelkyr, but they use that power for the Dreaming Dark.

### House Flae
House Flae is a warlock household that forms pacts with archfeys. They bring much of the entertainment to the Demesne by utilizing illusions and enchantments. Every party has at least a couple nobles from House Flae performing at it. They are also excellent spies and assassins. Recently, House Flae has begun to side more and more with House Xarmir. No one knows why. 

The real reason is that the Inspired within Hous Xarmir has finally infultrated their house. Soon, each house of powerful warlocks will be at the beck and call of the Dreaming Dark.

### House Grazirr
House Grazirr forms pacts with various celestial beings. They provide most of the medicine and healing within the Demesne.

### House Molesh
House Molesh forms pacts with various demonic Overlords. They serve as the military of the Demesne.

Warlord Bal Molesh is a strong ally of the Daughters, and some of his tiefling kin can be found in the service of Daask.
