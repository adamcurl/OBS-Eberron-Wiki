[[Droaam]]
1. **Type:** Town

Vralkek is a large town in Droaam, standing near the mouth of the Scar River on Manta Bay. It is Droaam's only port, and the fief of the fire giant warlord Gorodan Ashlord.

Gorodan allows anyone to dock at the port, so long as they are willing to pay his high fees. To protect commerce, he employs a goblin and ogre militia to enforce the law, but the laws themselves mainly serve the rich, the powerful, and those willing to line Gorodan's pockets with gold. Despite the appearance of order, Vralkek hosts its fair share of black markets and dark temples.

**Gorodan Ashlord**
Gorodan is originally from Xen'drik, but was banished by a fire giant king due to an overabundance of ambition. About 24 years ago, Gorodan travelled to Droaam with a small following of fire creatures, including azers, hell hounds and salamanders, as well as a few other fire giants. This proved sufficient to subjugate a local group of ogres and their goblin slaves, and he has ruled over a large fiefdom on the coast of the Thunder Sea ever since. When the Daughters of Sora Kell rose up to create Droaam, he begrudgingly swore allegiance to them, and received enough resources in return to allow him to build Vralkek, a settlement around his keep on the bluffs east of the Scar River. Despite this, his loyalty is not absolute, and he may work against the hags if he sees personal gains in doing so. Gorodon is generally disinterested in events in Khorvaire, but is quite knowledgeable about Xen'drik.
