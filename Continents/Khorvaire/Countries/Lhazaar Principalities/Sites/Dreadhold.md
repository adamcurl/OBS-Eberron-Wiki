## Outside

* Dreadhold is built on a Lamannian manifest zone with the Primordial Matter property.
* Housed on the entirety of an island, the prison looks like a pentagon building with only one story.
* The entire island is enchanted with [Forbiddance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/forbiddance)
* The prison is surrounded by 5 watchtowers on each corner. The only way to enter these watchtowers is from inside the building. Each watchtower contains an arcane ballista, and a spyglass, and 5 guards armed with crossbows and wands.
* There is also a stone wall that connects each watchtower with the only gate being in the front facing the docks.
* The edge of the stone walls hug the cliff sides, so that no one can traverse around the outside of the perimeter. 
* The dock has 5 guards stationed at all times and contains an elevator to lift people up to the front gate. There is one ship docked.
* Any ship or aircraft that is spotted within 5 miles of the island is met with an airship/ship and asked to state your business or leave.
* There are no windows, and only one door at the front of the building with an [Arcane Lock](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/arcane-lock) spell on it that only the higher up officers and the warden have a [keycharm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/keycharm) to. The interior of the building is also lined with an [Alarm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/alarm) spell. There is also an airship tied to the roof of the building.
* The perimeter of the building is patrolled by 5 groups of 10 officers in each direction.

## First Floor

* When you first enter the building, you are met with a reception area with no furniture with a guard behind a desk, with two other guards on each side. There are 2 doors on each side of the desk and a door directly behind him.
* The warden’s office is off to the left.
* The storeroom is off to the right. This houses all of the food and supplies.
* The guard barracks are in the back-left and back-right and contain all of the weapons and armor.
