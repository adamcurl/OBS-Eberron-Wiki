## History

   **-38,000 YK:** The first of the [goblinoid](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Goblinoids) kingdoms rises in the area that will one day become [Breland](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Breland) and [Darguun](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Darguun).


   The goblinoid race formed the predominant kingdoms of Khorvaire. 


   **-29,000 YK: **Orc nations rise in western Khorvaire to compete with the goblinoid kingdoms.


   **-19,000 YK: **The goblinoids push the kechuala ([lizardfolk](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Lizardfolk)) out of the [Talenta Plains](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Talenta_Plains) and into the [Endworld Mountains](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Endworld_Mountains). Many of the lizardfolk that survived the goblin armies die in the mountains. The small remaining fraction make their way into the jungle of what is now Q'barra.


   **-15,000 YK: **the Dhakaani united the goblinoid kingdoms to form the Dhakaani Kingdom. 


   **-4,000 YK:** Weakened after the Daelkyr War, the Dhakaani Kingdom collapsed due to internal power struggles and civil strife. This formed smaller goblinoid city-states and smaller nations.


   **2,000 YK: **Lhazaar leads [humans](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) from the continent of [Sarlona](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Sarlona) to the eastern shores of Khorvaire. The humans land in the pre-[Galifar](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Galifar) [Lhazaar Principalities](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Lhazaar_Principalities), and have little or no contact with the fractious goblin states.


   **-1,500 YK:** The humans begin to take over goblinoid-controlled territories to form the Five Nations.


   **-1,000 YK:** Karrn the Conqueror establishes the nation of Karrnath, defeats the remaining goblinoid settlements, forcing the remaining goblinoids to live in seclusion in uninhabited countries. Most of them retreated to the Seawall Mountains. This formed the hobgoblin clan, Ghaal’dar .


   **878 YK:** House Deneith begins to provide clients with golbinoid mercenaries from Darguun.


   **894 YK:** The Last War begins, and the demand for mercenaries draws the goblinoids out of the mountains and makes them a dominant military force.


   **969 YK:** After Cyre and Breland assigned the goblinoid mercenaries to protect a portion of Cyre bordering with Breland and Zilargo, Haruuc leads the hobgoblin rebellion against the nation of Cyre & Breland, and the nation of Darguun is born, taking the land from Cyre. Breland quicky negotiated an alliance with Haruuc, while Cyre fought them until the Day of Mourning.


   **996 YK:** The Treaty of Thronehold recognizes Darguun as an independent country.
