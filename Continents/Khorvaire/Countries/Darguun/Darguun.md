## Summary
Goblins and their kin have always been part of Khorvaire. Their ancient empire spread across the lands now held by other nations, and goblin foundations still stand underneath many human cities. This empire collapsed into savagery, and when humans arrived from Sarlona, they drove the goblins from their ancestral lands. Thus, goblins have long been a disenfranchised people, living in the shadows of newer nations or in wild lands shunned by humans.

The land now called Darguun was once part of Cyre. The hobgoblin clans known as the Ghaal’dar were based in the Seawall Mountains, but 30 years ago during the war, the demand for mercenaries drew an ever-increasing number of goblins out of the mountains to fight for Cyre and Breland. Late in the war, a brilliant hobgoblin named Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat’kor recognized that the goblins had become the dominant military power in the region. Uniting the Ghaal’dar under his banner, Haruuc seized the territory he was supposed to protect. The Five Nations were unprepared, and Breland quickly negotiated an alliance with Haruuc to secure the border. Cyre fought the goblins until the Day of Mourning, but the majority of delegates involved in forging the Treaty of Thronehold chose to recognize the new nation of Darguun to ensure peace.

Darguun is a young and volatile nation, ruled by Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat’kor. Haruuc remains a brilliant strategist and tactician, but many wonder whether he can maintain the web of alliances that hold the Ghaal’dar together, and whether he and his people will be content to abide by the terms of the treaty. Other goblins still hidden in the mountains—the enigmatic Heirs of Dhakaan—could pose a threat both to the goblins and the rest of Khorvaire.

Traditionally, the Ghaal’dar worshiped a form of the Dark Six. House Deneith introduced the Sovereign Host to the region, and some goblins have embraced this faith, especially the gods Dol Dorn, Dol Arrah, and Balinor.
  
**Muut and Atcha.** Goblinoid ancestors once forged an empire even greater than Galifar. The Dhakaani were renowned for their martial skill and their discipline. Muut roughly translates to “duty”—your duty to your empire, your clan, and your commander. Muut is expected; if you have no muut, you have no place in battle. Atcha corresponds to “honor,” especially your personal honor gained by virtuous deeds that transcend the expectations of muut.

## History

   **-38,000 YK:** The first of the [goblinoid](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Goblinoids) kingdoms rises in the area that will one day become [Breland](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Breland) and [Darguun](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Darguun).


   The goblinoid race formed the predominant kingdoms of Khorvaire. 


   **-29,000 YK: **Orc nations rise in western Khorvaire to compete with the goblinoid kingdoms.


   **-19,000 YK: **The goblinoids push the kechuala ([lizardfolk](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Lizardfolk)) out of the [Talenta Plains](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Talenta_Plains) and into the [Endworld Mountains](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Endworld_Mountains). Many of the lizardfolk that survived the goblin armies die in the mountains. The small remaining fraction make their way into the jungle of what is now Q'barra.


   **-15,000 YK: **the Dhakaani united the goblinoid kingdoms to form the Dhakaani Kingdom. 


   **-4,000 YK:** Weakened after the Daelkyr War, the Dhakaani Kingdom collapsed due to internal power struggles and civil strife. This formed smaller goblinoid city-states and smaller nations.


   **2,000 YK: **Lhazaar leads [humans](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) from the continent of [Sarlona](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Sarlona) to the eastern shores of Khorvaire. The humans land in the pre-[Galifar](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Galifar) [Lhazaar Principalities](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Lhazaar_Principalities), and have little or no contact with the fractious goblin states.


   **-1,500 YK:** The humans begin to take over goblinoid-controlled territories to form the Five Nations.


   **-1,000 YK:** Karrn the Conqueror establishes the nation of Karrnath, defeats the remaining goblinoid settlements, forcing the remaining goblinoids to live in seclusion in uninhabited countries. Most of them retreated to the Seawall Mountains. This formed the hobgoblin clan, Ghaal’dar .


   **878 YK:** House Deneith begins to provide clients with golbinoid mercenaries from Darguun.


   **894 YK:** The Last War begins, and the demand for mercenaries draws the goblinoids out of the mountains and makes them a dominant military force.


   **969 YK:** After Cyre and Breland assigned the goblinoid mercenaries to protect a portion of Cyre bordering with Breland and Zilargo, Haruuc leads the hobgoblin rebellion against the nation of Cyre & Breland, and the nation of Darguun is born, taking the land from Cyre. Breland quicky negotiated an alliance with Haruuc, while Cyre fought them until the Day of Mourning.


   **996 YK:** The Treaty of Thronehold recognizes Darguun as an independent country.

The goblinoid species — goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears — were once the dominant civilization in Khorvaire, with the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan ruling the continent for thousands of years. It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.

Goblins dwell in most of the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the Five Nations during the Last War.

### Ghaal'dar
The Ghaal’dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal’dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal’dar is filled with strife; when they weren’t fighting Galifar or Zilargo, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal’dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal’dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun. The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.

### Marguul
The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the Ghaal’dar long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal’dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide.

The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield.

### The Heirs of Dhakaani
Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds of corruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.

The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal’dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they’ve dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.

The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don’t have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh’dar (“silent folk”), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh’dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.
