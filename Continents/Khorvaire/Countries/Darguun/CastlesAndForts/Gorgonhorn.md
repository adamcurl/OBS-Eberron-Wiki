[[Darguun]]
1. **Type:** Castle/Fort

This fortified village lies close to the Mournland. Once it maintained the front line against Cyre. Now, the hobgoblins stationed here protect their people from the horrors that crawl out of the warped realm. If you’re a goblin soldier, you might have served in Gorgonhorn. It’s also a base for the scavengers and salvagers who venture into the Mournland.
