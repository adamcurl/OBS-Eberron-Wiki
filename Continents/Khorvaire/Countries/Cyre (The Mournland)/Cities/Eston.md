1. **Type:** City Ruin

Once the seat of House Cannith, this was a place of wonders—a city where “magic comes to life.” Marvels of the city included the Clockwork Menagerie, showcasing the golems and homunculi made by generations of artificers; production facilities that housed three creation forges, and the miraculous Steel Gardens, an early breakthrough that paved the way for the living warforged. If you’re an artificer or have ties to House Cannith, you might have roots in Eston.
