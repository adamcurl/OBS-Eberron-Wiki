[[Cyre]]
1. **Type:** Capital Ruin

Once the capital of Galifar, Metrol was known as the Rising City, for many of its buildings stood atop soaring columns of rock that dared to scrape the heavens. The Cathedral of the Sovereign Host was the center for followers of that faith. The Vault served as the mint and treasury of Galifar, containing cultural treasures deemed too valuable to be displayed; salvagers dream of finding this “golden palace.” Floating gardens orbited the towering Royal Vermishard. Now lost, the beauty of Metrol lives only in Cyran memory.
