[[Aundair]]
1. **Type:** Village

Arcanix is the most prestigious academy of magic in Khorvaire. Most of its sages specialize in ritual magic and abstract theory, and don’t have the full powers of wizards. 

This farming village on Lake Galifar provides food for the nearby floating towers of wizardry that serve as home to Aundair’s Arcane Congress—a cutting-edge research facility and the finest school of magic in Khorvaire. The members of the congress oversee the magical research conducted in these towers, advise Aundair’s queen on all things magical, and confer with colleagues visiting from other nations.

Apprentices come from all over Khorvaire to train at Arcanix. If you’re a wizard, sage, or artificer, you might have learned your craft here.

## Trials of the Ninefold Path
Before the war, the Arcane Congress served all Galifar. The most promising students from across Khorvaire came to study at Arcanix, and students from Khorvaire, Cyre, and Aundair worked together to win honor in the Trials of the Ninefold Path. Known to students simply as the Nine, this contest pits students of the eight traditions against one another in a series of arcane challenges, along with a ninth bracket for those who have yet to select a tradition. Teamwork, independence, memorization, innovation — the Nine challenges competitors on many levels, and the finest wizards of Galifar were invariably champions of the Nine.

Thanks to the Treaty of Thronehold, students of all nations once again study side by side in the towers of Arcanix. But no treaty or ritual can easily dispel the tensions of a century of war. Over the last year we’ve reported on a number of hate crimes in the towers fueled by nationalist passions. Optimistic teachers hope that the Nine will showcase the diversity that has evolved over the course of the past century — highlighting Karrnathi advances in necromancy and evocation, Cyran illusions, and more. But privately, professors fear that the competitive aspect of the Nine will inflame nationalist tension. Some even believe that the lives of foreign students could be endangered should they defeat Aundairian champions.

Only time will tell if the Nine can bring us together as it once did, or if it will drive us further apart.
