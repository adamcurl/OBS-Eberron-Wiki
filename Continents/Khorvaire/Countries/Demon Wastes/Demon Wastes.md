## History


   **-10,000,000 YK: **Khyber's fiendish offspring overrun the surface world, creating a hellish environment where [rakshasas](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Rakshasas) and [night hags](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Hag#Night_Hag) rule supreme.


   **-1,500,00 YK: **Dragons rediscover the Prophecy and rise from their primitive state to oppose their [demonic](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Demon) overlords. Unable to defeat the demonic hordes of the Dragon Below alone, the dragons ally with the [couatls](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Couatl).


   **-100,000 YK:** Recognizing their cause would otherwise be lost, the couatls sacrifice most of their number to bind the most powerful of the demon lords and the majority of the fiends back to Khyber. The couatls remain trapped for eternity with the fiends they bind. Victorious, the dragons retreat to [Argonnessen](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Argonnessen) to contemplate the Prophecy, ignoring the "lesser races."


   **?? YK: **The Lords of Dust form to unleash their ancient masters
