## History

**-1,500,000 YK: **Dragons rediscover the Prophecy and rise from their primitive state to oppose their [demonic](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Demon) overlords. Unable to defeat the demonic hordes of the Dragon Below alone, the dragons ally with the [couatls](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Couatl).

**-100,00 YK: **Recognizing their cause would otherwise be lost, the couatls sacrifice most of their number to bind the most powerful of the demon lords and the majority of the fiends back to Khyber. The couatls remain trapped for eternity with the fiends they bind. Victorious, the dragons retreat to [Argonnessen](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Argonnessen) to contemplate the Prophecy, ignoring the "lesser races."

**-75,000 YK: **Dragons and [dragonborn](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonborn) come to [Q'barra](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Q%27barra) to guard [Haka'torvhak](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Haka%27torvhak).

**-19,000 YK: **The goblinoids push the kechuala ([lizardfolk](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Lizardfolk)) out of the [Talenta Plains](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Talenta_Plains) and into the [Endworld Mountains](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Endworld_Mountains). Many of the lizardfolk that survived the goblin armies die in the mountains. The small remaining fraction make their way into the jungle of what is now Q'barra.

**928 YK: **Duke Ven ir'Kesslan leads settlers from Cyre to forge the nation of Q'barra.

**969 YK: **The Cold Sun Tribes begin to attack the new settlers

**970 YK: **The settlers successfully fend of the Cold Sun tribes for good due to superior weapons, magic, and strategy.

**975 YK: **The Twilight Walkers (one of the Cold Sun tribes) contacted the settlers and King Sebastes ir’Kesslan and formed a tenuous accord known as the [Vhak Za'shata](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Vhak_Za%27shata). The Twilight Walkers now act as liaison between the humans and the Cold Sun tribes.

**996 YK: **The Treaty of Thronehold officially ends the Last War. The treaty officially recognizes the nation of Q'barra.
