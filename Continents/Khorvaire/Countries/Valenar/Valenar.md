## History

**-80,000 YK: **The [giants](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Giants) rise from the ruins of the Dragon-Fiend Wars to establish a civilization on the continent of [Xen'drik](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Xen%27drik). They enslave the primitive [elves](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Elves), which has the inadvertent effect of pulling the first of the common races out of their primitive state.

**-60,000 YK: **The giants master the arcane arts, creating wonders unequaled even in the modern day. The elves - ignored by their giant masters - watch and learn.

**-39,000 YK: **1,000 years after the end of the Giant-Quori War, Xen'drik is still suffering from the magical backlash of disrupting Dal Quor's planar orbit. Horrible curses and plagues still sweep through the land, and the elves use the opportunity to rebel.

A corps of elves - called the [Phiarlan](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Phiarlan) or "Spirit Keepers" - work as [bards](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Bards), [scouts](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Scout), and couriers during the elven rebellion against the giants.

In a desperate attempt to regain control of their slaves and save their dying civilization, the giants turn again to the most powerful draconic magics. Before they can unleash such destruction a second time, the dragons attack Xen'drik and the giant civilization collapses.

The Phiarlan spread the word of the elven prophet Aeren, gathering elves to flee Xen'drik for the sub-continent that would become known as [Aerenal](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Aerenal). The elves who chose to stay behind in Xen'drik and go into hiding, become the [drow](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Drow).

**-38,000 YK: **The giants revert to primitive monsters living in the ruins of their shattered civilization as the dragons return to their secluded continent and the elves settle Aerenal.

**-29,000 YK: **Aerenal elves spread across the sub-continent of Aerenal, creating clusters of city-states.

**-25,000 YK: **First skirmish between the elves and the dragons, which sets a pattern of long periods of peace punctuated by short, devastating battles every few hundred years.

**-9,000 YK: **Aerenal elves establish a colony in what is now present-day [Valenar](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Valenar). Peaceful coexistence doesn't last, and the elves come into conflict with the Dhakaani. The elves abandon the colony when another clash with the dragons threatens Aerenal.

**-2,200 YK: **The [Mark of Shadow](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_of_Shadow) and the [Mark of Death](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_of_Death) appear among the elves of Aerenal. The dragons watch in awe and horror as the Prophecy begins to unfold among the “lesser” races.

**-1,600 YK: **Elves & dragons unite to destroy [House Vol](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/House_Vol) (which carries the Mark of Death), ending millennia of intermittent warfare between the two species.

**914 YK: **Cyre employes Elven mercenaries from Aerenal.

**956 YK: **Southern annex of Cyre becomes the Elf Nation of Valenar.

**996 YK: **The Treaty of Thronehold officially ends the Last War. The treaty officially recognizes Valenar.
