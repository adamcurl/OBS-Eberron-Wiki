## History

**-6,000 YK: **Zilargo gnomes begin to sow seeds of discourse among the goblinoids to break up their kingdom.

**-4,000 YK: **The [gnomes](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Gnomes) took over Dhakaani cities abandoned due to war-time depopulation as the Dhakaani were forced to consolidate their imperial holdings; the cities of [Korranberg](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Korranberg), [Trolanport](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Trolanport), and [Zolanberg](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Zolanberg) were the result, and are still the Zil people's greatest cities. They gathered the knowledge of magics and technologies left behind by the [hobgoblins](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Hobgoblins) and [daelkyr](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Daelkyr) and began to accumulate it and build on it. The [Library of Korranberg](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Library_of_Korranberg) was created on the foundations of this knowledge.

**-1,800 YK: **The [Mark of Scribing](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_of_Scribing) appears among the [gnomes](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Gnomes) of [Zilargo](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Zilargo).

**-1,000 YK: **After contact with the humans, Zilargo begins to form a stronger government and broadened the powers of the [Triumvirate](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Triumvirate), the council that oversaw affairs at the [Library of Korranberg](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Library_of_Korranberg), to encompass government of the entire nation and all the city-states of Zilargo. Representatives were chosen for each of the great Zil cities: [Korranberg](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Korranberg), [Trolanport](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Trolanport), and [Zolanberg](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Zolanberg).
