4. **Desc:** *Wroat, a great walled city, surrounds the shores of the Howling River, just a few miles east of where the Howling River meets the Dagger River. The city was built in a place where the river widens, so that the city lines not only both banks but also occupies an island that the city founders constructed in the middle of the river. Brokenblade Castle, the Citadel, and the walls and bridges of the city can be seen from a great distance, and while Wroat isn’t as spectacular as Sharn, it makes an impression on all who come to visit or trade.*

In contrast to its welcoming countenance, Wroat casts dark shadows, and much goes on quietly behind closed doors. The absence of beggars and riffraff in the streets might also raise suspicion that Wroat is putting on appearances. The King’s Dark Lanterns are ever vigilant here, and newcomers who aim to misbehave tend to disappear quickly and without so much as a whisper.

## Layout
Built on both sides of the Howling River at a point where the river widens, the ancestral seat of the rulers of Breland seduces visitors with its tree-lined avenues, elegant drawbridges, cleanliness, and laid-back atmosphere. Perched on a rocky island in the middle of the river, surrounded by military docks and barracks, is Brokenblade Castle, the king’s stern fortress.

On days when the cloud cover breaks, one can see the towers of Sharn rising in the south from the walls of Wroat or the castle parapets of Broken blade Castle and the Citadel. And to the east, the mountains of the Howling Peaks disappear into the constantly present storm clouds that crown the highest peaks.

Wroat, whose skyline stretches along both sides of the Howling River, is located at the junction where that waterway meets the Dagger River. Two large temples—one dedicated to the Sovereign Host, the other to the Silver Flame— dominate the Street of Worship. Other impressive structures include Brokenblade Castle, Parliament Hall, the Citadel, the Wroat campus of Morgrave University, and the Galifar Museum.

### Brokenblade Castle
*The ancestral home of the rulers of Breland, Brokenblade Castle features darkgray stone piled high to create a powerful keep and towered castle. A sturdy wall surrounds the grounds, creating a defensible position within the walled city. It is further protected and set off by being constructed atop a man-made island in the middle of the Howling River, at the place where the river widens before meeting up with the Dagger River.*

The castle features both living quarters for the royal family and public areas where the king and his court can conduct the business of state. The Great Hall, a massive chamber decorated in the rustic style, with open hearths, log-framed ceilings and walls, houses the king’s public throne. This massive stone-and-wood chair seems to fit Boranel like a glove, and he holds court and hears petitions while seated in it.

### The Citadel
*The offices and training facilities of the King’s Citadel fill this massive obsidian tower and compound located directly across from the grounds of Brokenblade Castle. Agents of the Citadel travel throughout Breland, dispensing the King’s justice while serving as the eyes, ears, and strong right arm of the crown.*

[[Kor ir’Wynarn|Lord Kor ir’Wynarn]] commands the Citadel, serving as conduit between his captains and King Boranel. Five agencies operate as separate divisions within the Citadel: Swords, Shields, Wands, Dark Lanterns, and Shadows.

The King’s Swords, commanded by [[Captain Ellanar]], consists of elite warriors trained to operate far and wide on missions in service to the King.

The King’s Shields, led by [[Captain Sortan]], provide protection for the royal family and other dignitaries, as well as overseeing matters of royal security throughout the kingdom.

[[Captain Nebik]] commands the King’s Wands, a division of wizards and sorcerers used to provide magical support and to undertake missions that require arcane talents. The agents of the Wands usually work as part of a task force made up of operatives from at least two parts of the Citadel.

The King’s Dark Lanterns, one of two secret divisions operating under the auspices of the Citadel, gathers intelligence and performs espionage missions for the crown. [[Captain Vron]] commands the Dark Lanterns, and he keeps in close contact with Lord Kor and King Boranel about many of his division’s ongoing activities.

The King’s Shadows, under the direction of [[Captain Terra]], is the second secret division working within the Citadel structure. The smallest and most exclusive branch of the Citadel, the Shadows only employs the most seasoned, most trusted, and most elite agents in service to the king. An agent of the Shadows always appears to be either a member of one of the Citadel’s public divisions (Swords, Shields, or Wands) or as someone not connected to the Citadel at all, depending on the nature of the mission. The King’s Shadows do what must be done, with the authority of the crown but also with enough secrecy that Boranel can disavow knowledge of their activities when necessary. Indeed, one of the King’s Shadows operates under the knowledge that the crown may not back him if a mission gets into trouble.

All Citadel agents need to be part warrior, part spy, and part inquisitive, ready to handle whatever threats or situations come to their attention in the execution of their duties.

### Parliament Hall
The legislative branch of the Brelish government operates out of an historic facility on the southern shore of the Howling River. The Parliament Hall consists of two chambers and a series of surrounding offi ces. Each member of the Parliament and their staffs have an offi ce in the building, but the real work of the Parliament takes place within the two meeting chambers.

**The Noble Chamber** provides space for the hereditary members of Parliament to meet and debate the issues before them. These are the representatives of the noble families of Breland, and all twenty-seven have a seat in Parliament.

**The Commons Chamber** provides similar space for the legislators that are elected by popular vote. These are the representatives of villages, towns, and cities that stretch across the Brelish countryside; each serves a two-year term, but reelection is commonplace.

When the full Parliament gets together to vote on pressing matters, the wall between the two chambers is removed, creating a single large hall.

### Lightning Rail Station
The lightning rail station in Wroat provides service to Sharn, Aundair, Thrane, and Zilargo. The lightning rail departs twice daily, in the afternoon and at night.

### Tower of Inquisition
Located in the SouthEast region of Wroat, this is the headquarters for house Medani, run by Baron Trelib. This is also where prisoners are interrogated for King Boranel.

### Inns
#### Gold Dragon Inn
Chain inn run by House Ghallanda.

#### The Bear's Den
A highly sought after, comfortable local inn on the Soutwest side of Wroat, this inn is extremely cozy with Brelish decor. The inn serves Brelish cuisine - spicy ginger soup, sautéed garlic beef, curried chicken, and the like. It is run by an elderly human couple with a half-orc chef. An agent of House Phiarlan is always performing here.

#### The Blade's Scabbard
This inn is of modest quality and caters to veterans of the Last War. It is run by Deriv (LN M human), who has a prosthetic in place of one of his arms.

### Shops
#### The Sphinx's Nook
A nice bookstore next to Morgrave University run by Dadi Goldbirth (CE F elf) that sells an array of books and spells.

#### Tantilizing Trinkets
A magic item shop run by Finny (CG F gnome).

## Politics
