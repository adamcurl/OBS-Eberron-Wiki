[[Breland]]
1. **Type:** City
2. **Population:** 200,000
3. Sharn is built atop a Syranian manifest zone with a lesser version of the [[Syrania#^05cb51|Unburdened property]].

## Layout
### Towers
The towers of Sharn range in height from about 100 feet to nearly a mile tall, but their basic construction resembles that of a traditional castle or other stone building. Extensive magic goes into their construction, from the spells used to lift blocks of stone to such enormous heights to the magic that strengthens and supports the towers, allowing them to stand despite all probability. Even with such magic in place, the towers are generally broad at the bottom and narrow at the top, many of them peaking in elegant spires or domes, while others are crowned with flat platforms that hold parks, pools, or small estates. The streets of the ancient city have been swallowed up as towers were built upward and lower walls thickened, to the point that now the towers tend to merge at ground level into a solid maze of walls, jumbled together with no discernable pattern.

Most towers are roughly 800 to 2,500 feet in diameter at the bottom, narrowing to about 200 to 600 feet in diameter at the top. Some have narrower spires extending farther upward.

Every tower is built of magically reinforced stone, with hardness 16 and AC 3. Climbing a tower wall requires a DC 22 Climb check. A typical LowerCity exterior wall is 15 feet thick, with 2,340 hp per 10-foot section. In the Middle-City, exterior walls are 10 feet thick, with 1,440 hp per 10-foot section. In the Upper-City, exterior walls are only 5 feet thick, with 900 hp per 10-foot section. Interior walls also consist of stone construction. Some serve important structural functions and are as thick as exterior walls, but most are only 1 foot thick, with 90 hp per 10-foot section.

In general, a tower has one story per 10–12 feet of height. Ceilings tend to be lower (and stories packed more closely together) at lower levels and higher toward the top levels, but there are certainly exceptions (warehouse towers, for example, usually have high ceilings). Stories might also be sub divided: a popular residential design features an open central plaza, 20 feet or more in height, surrounded by two-story homes built as if hanging off the wall of the tower. A minor variation on this design has even higher ceilings and three-story units surrounding the plaza, with the bottom story of each unit housing a business.

Most towers are studded with balconies, riddled with windows, and connected to neighboring towers with bridges.

### Balconies
Balconies range from simple ledges with protective railings where a homeowner can step outside to enjoy the sunset, to large platforms where skycars can land to discharge passengers. Most towers have at least one balcony per story; many towers have many more balconies, at least at certain levels. Since fl ying is so prevalent in the city, any balcony is a potential entry point to a tower. Balconies opening into businesses or residences can be secured by some means, ranging from a simple door or portcullis to magical means such as a wall of force or an alarm spell. A great number of balconies, particularly the larger ones, open into public space.

### Streets
Streets run through the towers of Sharn, allowing horses, mules, and wagons to travel in a fairly normal fashion within the city. Unlike the streets of a typical city, most of these streets are broad thoroughfares rather than twisting alleyways, either suspended high above the ground, arcing around towers, or constructed through the center of a tower or other building. As described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, these streets are 25 feet wide with 5-foot-wide walkways on either side.

Because the streets of Sharn are almost entirely indoors, most are artifi cially lit with everbright lanterns or everburning torches. In general, the upper levels have the best lighting, while torches in the Cogs are spaced so far apart as to leave large spaces of darkness.

### Bridges
Most bridges connect the streets running through the towers, allowing wagons and pedestrians to cross from one spire to the next. As such, they are generally as wide as the streets. Low walls along the edges of a bridge prevent people from falling accidentally. Major bridges can be as wide as 50 feet across, and actually have structures built along the edges, crowding the roadway down to a width of 10 feet or so. Such bridges are popular sites for street fairs and open markets.

### Lifts
One of the most important uses of magic in Sharn is in the creation of magic lifts to facilitate vertical travel between the levels of towers. Particularly at lower levels, ramps wind around the inside or outside of large towers to get wagons from level to level, but at higher levels special levitation devices carry passengers and even cargo up and down within the towers.

### Falling
The city offers a standard reward of 25 gp to a spellcaster who casts feather fall on a falling person. The reward is large enough, and the risk of falling real enough, that spellcasters who can cast feather fall almost always keep one prepared on a daily basis. Watch patrols usually carry a wand of feather fall, but few members are proficient enough to activate it.

## Politics

### City Council
Many make the mistake of assuming that the Lord Mayor of Sharn holds the greatest power within the city. In fact, the City Council appoints the Lord Mayor, and the commanders of the Sharn Watch report to the Council.

The Council of Sharn is comprised of 17 councilors: one from each of the wards of the city, with Cliffside merged into Dura and a single councilor representing both Ashblack and Blackbones.

All major political appointments in Sharn occur on 9 Rhaan, Boldrei’s Feast. Members of the Breland Parliament serve two-year terms, city councilors serve for three years, and the Lord Mayor’s performance is usually reviewed every four years. There are no term limits, and quite often an election passes with no changes whatsoever.

#### Councilors:
- **Upper Central:** [[Councilor Javan Tomollan]]
- **Middle Central:** [[Councilor Sorik Sensos]]
- **Lower Central:** [[Councilor Sava Kharisa]]
- **Upper Menthis:** [[Councilor Thurik Davandi]]
- **Middle Menthis:** [[Councilor Caskar Halavik]]
- **Lower Menthis:** [[Councilor Savia Potellas]]
- **Upper Northedge:** [[Councilor Maza Thadian]]
- **Middle Northedge:** [[Councilor Doran Cantar]]
- **Lower Northedge:** [[Councilor Shassa Tarr]]
- **Upper Tavick's Landing:** [[Councilor Bestan ir’Tonn]]
- **Middle Tavick's Landing:** [[Councilor Dalaina Ironhand]]
- **Lower Tavick's Landing:** [[Councilor Kilk]]
- **Upper Dura:** [[Councilor Borian Haldorak]]
- **Middle Dura:** [[Councilor Hruitt]]
- **Lower Dura:** [[Councilor Ilyra Boromar]]
- **Skyway:** [[Councilor Evix ir’Marasha]]
- **The Cogs:** [[Councilor Nolan Toranak]]

### The Lord Mayor
While the City Council holds the true power in Sharn, the Lord Mayor is still a force to be reckoned with. The Lord Mayor represents the interests of Sharn in any direct contact with the Brelish Crown, including interaction with the King’s Citadel. He also appoints the lesser officers of the city and oversees all issues of daily administration. He has the power to establish trade agreements with foreign governments, to pardon criminals, and to order arrests and even executions. His worship [[Cathan ir’Demell]] has been Lord Mayor of Sharn for twenty years, and he enjoys the luxuries and privileges of his position. He is unlikely to take any actions that would anger Javan Tomollan or Bestan ir’Tonn, his strongest supporters in the council, and he usually consults with these two before making any major decisions.

### The King's Citadel
The City Council and the Lord Mayor represent the interests of Sharn; they are not direct servants of the king. The King’s Citadel looks after the interests of the crown, and can assert jurisdiction over any criminal matter or issue concerning espionage or national security.

### The Sixty Families of Sharn
Twenty-fi ve of the twenty-seven noble families of Breland have strong ties and interests in Sharn, along with all of the dragonmarked houses. But the majority of the wealth of the city lies in the hands of the gentry: merchants and landowners who have built their fortunes through centuries of hard work and clever investment. There are hundreds of powerful families in the City of Towers, but a few stand out from the rest. These are known as the Sixty.

Sharn was built with the gold of the ir’Tain family, and today the ir’Tains are the most powerful and infl uential family in the city. Once each month, they hold a grand party for the aristocracy—The Tain Gala. When the ir’Tains were building their new manor on Skyway, Lady Shala told the architects to make the banquet hall large enough to seat sixty families and their servants. The Sixty of Sharn are those with standing invitations to the Tain Gala—the clear sign of success. It should be noted that other people may attend the gala, as it is uncommon for all sixty families to bring all of their family members and servants, and the hall was designed to hold entertainers as well as guests. But a single invitation, while prestigious, is entirely different from being invited to join the Sixty.

The Sixty is more of a social club—a visible manifestation of the most powerful families in Sharn. Members of the Sixty discuss politics and business at the Tain Galas, and these discussions can have an impact on adventurers, Sharn, or even Breland. But the Sixty almost never act as a concerted unit, and many members are actually bitter rivals beyond the walls of the Tain Manor.

All of the noble families and the dragonmarked families are members of the Sixty; this means that any Sharn resident with the ir’ or d’ prefix on his last name could be found at the Tain Gala. Other members are generally identifi ed as such in their descriptions. A standing invitation can always be revoked to make room for a more deserving candidate; one of the greatest fears of Councilor Sorik Senso is that his family will be displaced to make room for Councilor Javan Tomollan.

### The Dragonmarked Houses
While all of the dragonmarked houses have some presence in Sharn, four of the houses are particularly important in the city: House [[Cannith]], House [[Deneith]], House [[Kundarak]], and House [[Sivis]].

#### Cannith
See [[Cannith#^e60b73|Cannith South Faction]].

#### Deneith
See [[Deneith#^a85be8|Deneith Sharn Branch]].

#### Kundarak
See [[Kundarak#^293353|Kundarak Sharn Branch]].

#### Sivis
See [[Sivis#^b39f1b|Sivis Sharn Branch]].

### Foreign Powers
Most of the nations of Eberron have established embassies or consulates in Sharn to protect their interests and to resolve diplomatic and trade disputes. There are a number of exceptions, of course. Darguun, the Shadow Marches, and the Eldeen Reaches do not have offi cial representatives in Sharn. Other nations have different levels of representation, as described below. Unless otherwise mentioned, all consulates are located in Ambassador Towers in Middle Central.

Unfortunately, consuls tend to be very busy individuals, and they rarely have the time or inclination to address the problems of individual citizens. Arranging to see a consul requires a minimum of a DC 20 Charisma check, and may require bribery as well. Even if this check succeeds, it may still take some time for the meeting to take place, and there may be nothing that the consul can do to help. Unless a character is an important person—a high-level aristocrat, for example—the consulate won’t take any risks to provided aid.

#### Aerenal
Aerenal lumber—densewood, bronzewood, darkwood, and the other products of the great jungles—is an important commodity. [[Lady Taelira]] is the consul of Aerenal, and has held this post for over 300 years. Taelira has little interest in the wars or confl icts of the younger races, and she is unlikely to take an interest in anything that adventurers bring to her attention; if there’s a problem, her inclination is to wait a year and see if it’s still an issue. Trade agreements are an exception to this rule, and Taelira is a vicious negotiator when it comes to protecting the economic interests of the elves.

While she is rarely helpful, Lady Taelira shows more respect toward characters who possess the Right of Counsel. She is also a confidant of [[Mayne Jhaelian]], the priest of Shae Lias, and if Mayne sends the characters to Taelira, she listens.

#### Aundair
During the Last War, the battles between Aundair and Breland left deep scars on both lands. But while fi erce, these confl icts were brief, and by the close of the war the two nations were strong allies. Today, Alais and Helais ir’Lantar, sons of one of the noble families of Aundair, serve the interests of their nation in Sharn. Alais and Helais are identical twin brothers, and both are remarkably handsome and urbane; they are quite popular at galas and other social events. While both brothers are officially ambassadors, each performs different duties. [[Alais ir’Lantar]] deals with the administrative drudgery, while [[Helais ir'Lantar]] handles the deeper diplomacy and intrigue. Why? Because Helais is not simply an ambassador—he is one of the Royal Eyes of Aundair, a trusted agent who serves as Queen Aurala’s eyes and ears in Sharn. But Queen Aurala has been betrayed, and her misplaced trust may spell disaster in the future. His role as master of spies is the least of Helais’s secrets. The dark truth is that there is only one ir’Lantar brother. The ir’Lantar family has served the Lords of Dust for many generations, and Helais ir’Lantar is actually a guise used by the two rakshasas of Sharn, [[Zathara]] and [[Nethatar]].

Alais is well aware of his brother’s true nature. He is a cruel, conniving man who enjoys assisting the Lords of Dust with their schemes. In addition to the power he gains from the alliance, Alais feels that his connection to the rakshasas puts him above mere mortals; he suffers from the delusion that if he serves the Lords faithfully, he may one day be transformed into a rakshasa himself.

Usually, one of the two rakshasa poses as Helais, while the other is disguised in a different form elsewhere in the city. However, as Alais and Helais are identical twins, this allows for a host of possibilities. If necessary, the two rakshasa can appear as Alais and Helais; at other times, Alais poses as his brother. Alais wears a ring of mind shielding and the Lords of Dust possess masks of the misplaced aura, so it is extremely diffi cult to pierce these deceptions.

#### Cyre
While Cyre now exists only as an idea, a few years ago it was a powerful nation, and Cyran embassies still exist in the great courts of Khorvaire. Many nations have expelled the Cyran ambassadors—what use is an ambassador without a country? However, Breland has taken in a large number of Cyran refugees, and has even allowed the creation of the city of New Cyre on its northwestern border. As a result, Sharn has allowed the embassy of Cyre to remain open.

The primary function of the Cyran embassy is to coordinate refugee activities and provide a point of contact for New Cyre. The few surviving Cyran nobles realize the precariousness of their situation. They have lost the wealth and resources of their nation, along with the bulk of their military power. New Cyre only exists because of the generosity of King Boranel—and if the Cyrans have nothing to offer or are perceived as a threat, that generosity could eventually fade. The embassy staff spends much of its time among the refugees in Lower Tavick’s Landing, recording the identities and skills of Cyran refugees and trying to find positions for them within the city.

Refugees and people with strong family ties to Cyre are placed under a lot of pressure to help restore the old kingdom, or at least to help it continue to exist as a ghost. Refugees are expected to donate 20% of their income to the embassy toward the recreation of Cyre. This includes adventurers, although the ambassador has no way to measure the income of an adventurer or real power to punish him, save by laying shame on his family. Cyran adventurers are frequently asked to perform services on behalf of New Cyre. This typically involves recovering treasures from the Mournland, searching for clues about the origin of the Day of Mourning, or assisting other powerful people with whom the Cyrans are trying to curry favor.

However, there are those among the surviving nobles who feel that their proud nation should not exist as a memory or as a gift from Breland. They plan to seize new land, whether from Breland, Darguun, Valenar or some other nation entirely. This would require powerful magic artifacts—perhaps ancient weapons hidden in Xen’drik—or dangerous dealings with the Lords of Dust, the Inspired, or the Order of the Emerald Claw. A Cyran character may be drawn into these plots knowingly or unwittingly—and he must decide just how much he is willing to risk for his country.

The Cyran ambassador to Sharn is [[Lord Jairan ir’Dain]]. Jairan still plays the role of the proud noble, attending social functions in his fi ne clothes, but he lost his fortune on the Day of Mourning and his glamerweave doublets are becoming increasingly threadbare. Jairan is an optimist, and he believes that somehow if he keeps doing his job Cyre will be restored—that New Cyre can peacefully grow, and perhaps reclaim the blasted Mournland.

The Cyran spymaster [[Tyrala]] is Jairan’s mirror image. She is obsessed with the survival of Cyre and will use any means necessary to achieve that goal, however questionable they may be. Jairan may ask a Cyran character to perform an altruistic deed; Tyrala’s requests are often morally ambiguous, though they may have more concrete results. Tyrala firmly believes that one of the other nations was behind the destruction of Cyre, and she is determined to fi nd out who did it and how, and to take a bitter vengeance. She uses this as a lever against a Cyran character—doesn’t he want revenge for the hundreds of thousands of his people who were killed? Doesn’t he want to prevent this from ever happening again? The embassy can draw on the discretionary funds held in the Kundarak Bank, but it has little to offer—its primary currency is loyalty to the lost nation.

There are a few other notable Cyran NPCs scattered throughout the city. [[Doras]] is a village reeve who was visiting a cousin in Smoky Towers on the Day of Mourning. Today he remains in Smoky Towers as an insurgent, urging people with Cyran blood to come to the aid of their ancestral homeland. The Guardians of the Gate and the Citadel both keep a close watch on Doras, but he has yet to be arrested. [[Cala Narain]] was a captain in the Queen’s Forward Blades, a scouting unit. Currently, she is the highest-ranking Cyran military officer in Sharn, and she has been trying to organize the scattered soldiers among the many refugees. [[Holt]] is a warforged bodyguard who usually travels with Lord ir’Dain or Tyrala when they leave the embassy.

#### Darguun
Lhesh Haruuc of Darguun is a warrior first and a diplomat second, and under his rule Darguun has not established any embassies in Khorvaire. Most diplomatic contacts with the court of Darguun are carried out through House Deneith, which maintains close ties with Lhesh Haruuc to negotiate the services of mercenary troops.

Should a party feel the need to speak directly with inhabitants of Darguun, they should go to Malleon’s Gate in Lower Dura. A hobgoblin troop known as the Ja’khor (Blackbloods) is using the Bloodstone Inn as a base of operations. The war leader, [[Margaash]], is not a merchant, and he generally relies on House Deneith to negotiate contracts on his behalf. However, for the right price he may be willing to provide information or even a goblin guide to help a party traveling to Darguun. Margaash only respects strength; fighters get better results than wizards.

In addition to the Blackbloods, there are a number of expatriate Darguuls in Lower Dura and the Dura Cogs. The Mhaaca are a small family of bugbears who sell their services as heavy laborers. A few of the Mhaaca have broken off from the main family and joined the Cog gangs: [[Rhash’mhaac]] has established his own gang of goblins, while [[Kharmhaac]] has joined the Red Jackals, much to the frustration of their father [[Dhurmhaac]].

#### Droaam
The monstrous nation of Droaam did not participate in the Treaty of Thronehold, and the Brelish crown does not recognize the power or authority of the hags that rule there. In recent years, House Tharashk has developed strong ties to Droaam, and the House of Finding serves as an intermediary for most dealings with the Crag.

However, the one direct representative of the hags in Sharn is [[Cavallah]] —the ogre mage who leads the criminal organization known as Daask.

Many of the monstrous inhabitants of the city are either working for House Tharashk or Daask, but there are monstrous citizens who have settled in Sharn to pursue other opportunities. These include ogres and gnolls in the Cogs, and a few more exotic creatures in the upper levels. Some of these creatures are petty criminals, while others find honest work as laborers. While they have no official ties to Daask, most recognize Cavallah’s authority—or at least are so afraid of her that they obey her commands if she calls upon them.

One particularly unusual expatriate Droaamite is [[Karg]], an exceptionally intelligent ogre (Intelligence 10) who stumbled upon a cache of Dhakaani treasure a few years ago. Knowing that one of the more powerful monsters would take this prize away from him if he stayed in Droaam, Karg came to Sharn. He has spent the last four years studying at Morgrave University; he wants to become a master sage, and he is particularly fascinated by the history of Xen’drik and the empire of the giants. Karg is afraid of Daask, and does not venture into Lower Dura or the Cogs.

#### Karrnath
The embassy of Karrnath is a brooding fortress in the midst of Ambassador Towers. The Karrns are always prepared for the worst, and the embassy is designed to endure a siege. The interior of the embassy is fi lled with glyphs of warding, alarms, and arcane seals—one wrong step can prove deadly. The embassy contains its own garrison of elite soldiers, commanded by [[Kanarr Talan]] —20 3rd level fighters, all prepared to die in the service of Karrnath. Riots, thieves, spies—the Karrns are ready to deal with them all.

[[Ambassador Syra ir’Tarrn]] is a brilliant diplomat, and she is completely devoted to her nation and her king. She has no ties to the Order of the Emerald Claw, and she doesn’t even know about the hidden temple of the Blood of Vol in Graywall. Syra deals with the legitimate diplomatic activities of the embassy, while Malen Torr, a ruthless spymaster, handles espionage and shadow work.

[[Malen Torr]] is loyal to Karrnath, but he does not approve of the king’s promotion of peace; Malen believes that the only way to secure true peace is to restore Galifar under Karrn rule. He has made contact with a number of the warlords of Karrnath who share his opinions, and in the future he may set plots in motion to disrupt the peace process and to weaken Breland or gain control of new weapons for Karrnath. Depending on the political and ethical alignment of a party of adventurers, Malen could be a valuable patron or a deadly foe.

#### Lhazaar Principalities
Each of the Lhazaar princes has his own agenda, and each prince has a personal representative at the embassy in Sharn. These ambassadors spend most of their time in trade negotiations and denying rumors of Lhazaar piracy. The Lhazaar embassy is unstable at best, and the ambassadors come and go as they please; it’s impossible to predict who will be in residence in the embassy at any given time. To make matters worse, the ambassadors frequently engage in feuds and vendettas on behalf of their lords. The embassy itself is neutral territory, but beyond its walls anything can happen.

#### The Mror Holds
The Mror Holds are a loose confederation of clans, each with its own mercantile interests. Each of the holds has a representative at the Mror consulate, who negotiates on behalf of his clan. These consuls are devoted to their work, and compared to the Lhazaar ambassadors there is little confl ict among the dwarves. The dwarf consuls rarely have any use for adventurers, and it would be extremely unusual for a party to be called to the consulate.

The most noteworthy consul is [[Lain of Clan Soldorak]], a socialite who often hosts lavish galas at his estate in Highhold. Lain is a member of the Aurum and reports to Antus Soldarak, the chairman of the Platinum Concord. In Sharn, Kalphan Riak is the highest-ranking member of the cabal, but Lain may make a good opponent for lower-level adventurers. The Soldorak family has an ancient grudge against House Kundarak; if the party includes a Kundarak heir, Lain may send misfortune their way.

#### Riedra
After a thousand years of silence and secrecy, the Inspired have finally emerged from the shadows of Sarlona. Riedra itself remains a mystery; visitors are not welcome in the land of the Inspired. But the ambassadors of Riedra can be found in all of the courts of Khorvaire. They are charming and urbane, generous with gifts and eager to help the nations of Khorvaire recover from the physical and psychological damage of the Last War. Most are happy to receive the assistance of the Riedrans. But there are some who wonder about the true motives of the Inspired — some who suspect that the lords of the silent empire are preparing to expand their dominion.

[[Ambassador Jorasesh]] spends most of his time in negotiations, discussing trade, the reconstruction of Khorvaire, and the exploration of Xen’drik. However, he is a philosopher and historian, and when he is not at the embassy or attending a gala event, he often visits Morgrave University. Jorasesh is slowly developing a following at the University; he is brilliant and charismatic, and students and sages alike are intrigued by the handsome Inspired lord.

Most of the members of the embassy staff are humans from Riedra. Chosen for their complete loyalty to the Inspired, these people rarely speak to outsiders; many do not even understand the Common tongue. In addition to scribes, servants, and soldiers, the embassy staff includes the following special operatives:
- [[Maleshari]]
- [[Helkashtai]]
- [[Minharkhad]]

#### Q'barra
Most of the citizens of the Kingdom of New Galifar—also known as Q’barra—consider the people of the western lands to be corrupt warmongers. Q’barra participated in the Treaty of Thronehold, but it has little interest in trade with Breland; the Q’barrans primarily deal with the Mror Holds, the Lhazaar Princes, and the Inspired lords of Riedra. As a result, Q’barra does not maintain an offi cial embassy or consulate in Sharn. Unoffi cially, Q’barra’s interests are represented by [[Joseth ir’Kalain]].

#### The Talenta Plains
The people of the Talenta Plains have little interest in political machinations. Stories say that they draw straws to see who has to serve as an ambassador, but these rumors are false. In truth, they fi ght duels, with the losers being sent to the courts of the western nations. [[Ambassador R’tannan]] attends diplomatic meetings and trade negotiations, but he is far more interested in gambling, especially on the many races that occur in the city.

The Talenta embassy has no direct connection with the Boromar Clan, House Ghallanda, or House Jorasco.

#### Thrane
The lords of Thrane still hold Queen Wroann responsible for the Last War, and relations between the two countries have never been warm—though this general distaste pales in comparison to the hatred the people of Thrane have for the Karrns.

[[Lady Anador ir'Laisha]] monitors events in the city on behalf of her nation, but rarely becomes actively involved in local affairs. She is devoted to the Silver Flame and attends services at the Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame. Blinded by her faith, Lady ir’Laisha trusts the Archierophant,[[Ythana Morr]], implicitly and angrily dismisses any suggestions that Ythana might be using the power of the Church for her own benefit. Lady ir’Laisha’s devotion to the church is greater then loyalty to her country, and she may be manipulated into unknowingly assisting Ythana with a nefarious scheme.

#### Valenar
The elves of the Valaes Tairn are warriors with a thirst for glory. They are never happier than when battling against overwhelming odds, honoring the spirits of their ancestors with spirit and song. While the High King signed the Treaty of Thronehold, the elves have not abided by its restrictions, and have continued to raid from Darguun to Karrnath. Someone has to appease the lords of the western kingdoms, to convince kings and princes that the actions of the elves pose no threat. This is the work of [[Daera Sorandal]], a warrior who fights her battles with words. One of the finest diplomats in Khorvaire, Daera dances through the courts of the land singing a new song wherever she goes. In Breland, she emphasizes how the elves are weakening and distracting the dangerous hobgoblins of Darguun. In Thrane, she claims that the Valaes Tairn cannot sit by while the Karrn continue their evil ways. In Karrnath, she dismisses the attacks as the work of criminals and outlaws. She has a different story for every lord she visits—and so far, she has kept the nations from banding together against the elves.

There is no Valenar embassy in Sharn. An embassy would be a prison, and Daera Sorandal prefers to remain in constant motion, fighting a new battle every day. In Sharn, the Valenar are represented by Caerlyn’s Blade, a mercenary troop based in the Bazaar of Middle Dura. When Daera comes to the city, she generally stays with these warriors. If adventurers need to do business with the Valaes Tairn, they should begin by speaking with [[Caerlyn Tyrell]], the commander of the Blade. If he can’t help them, he may at least know where Daera can be found. Of course, he needs a reason to help them. Caerlyn will shed blood in exchange for gold, but his friendship cannot be bought—it must be earned. A character who defeats Caerlyn in a duel or a race, or even someone who challenges him and loses the contest, is more likely to receive help than someone who tries to buy information from him.

#### Zilargo
The Zilargo embassy was built long before the Last War, to facilitate trade between Zilargo and Galifar. Zilargo remained one of Breland’s closest allies throughout the Last War, and that alliance is still strong today. Zil artificers and engineers produce many of their wares in the great factories of Breland, and the Brelish refineries sell much of their ore to Zilargo. Most of the time, the gnomes pay for these services with gold, jewels, or ships. But the gnomes are also masters of intrigue, and throughout the war the intelligence gathered by Zil spies was invaluable to the Brelish war effort.

Today, Khorvaire is at peace. But the Trust intends to be prepared for the next war long before it occurs. The embassy of Zilargo is a labyrinth of intrigue; almost everyone who works in the embassy has a secret secondary role, from the ambassador to the lowliest servant. With the gnomes of Zilargo, nothing can truly be trusted. The embassy staff includes the following remarkable individuals:

- [[Tasho Mol Doras]], the ambassador of Zilargo, is a brilliant diplomat and ruthless negotiator. He is always looking for a way to get an edge over his political and mercantile opponents, and quickly seizes upon any sign weakness and exploits it. He is a skilled actor and can feign a wide range of emotions, but when the interests of his nation or family are at stake, he acts without mercy.
- [[Doran Del Doras]] is the true power in the embassy of Zilargo. Tasho is the ambassador, but Doran is the master of spies, and even Tasho follows his orders. Aside from the embassy staff—many of whom have 2 to 3 rogue, bard, or expert levels—Doran has contacts spread throughout Sharn and across Breland itself. He has permanent Rary’s telepathic bonds that allow him to communicate with Madra Sil Sarin and his superior in the Trust in Korranberg.

   Doran Del Doras is always expanding his network of informants and spies, and any character— gnome or not—could be drawn into his web.
- [[Madra Sil Sarin]] is the deadliest assassin in the service of the Trust. She is a disturbing enigma even to the other gnomes; she answers only to the Trust, and she has killed quite a few gnomes to preserve the secrets of the embassy. Doran can use his telepathic bond to request her services, but only the Trust can approve an assassination. It is important to remember this: while she is one of the most dangerous women in Khorvaire, she only acts if she has direct orders from Zilargo. She does not use her skills lightly or squander them on personal vendettas.

   Madra spends most of her time under cover of invisibility, silently watching the city and waiting for instructions. With her ring of sustenance and telepathic bonds, she rarely needs to verbally or physically interact with people (she uses prestidigitation to keep her clothing clean). She is often called out of Sharn to serve the Trust in other parts of Khorvaire—but it’s usually impossible to tell. And, of course, there may be any number of additional Zil assassins hidden in the embassy waiting to be activated—though it is unlikely that any possess the skills or equipment to match Madra.
- [[Cassia Lyrriman Dal]] is a priestess of Aureon. Like Holas, she is a supernatural spy, using augury, divination, speak with dead and other spells to help Doran gather information and formulate plans. She is fascinated by all religions, and whenever she encounters another adept or priest she tries to start a discussion about her own theories about the nature of the gods and the foundation of divine magic.

When it gets down to it, the Watch has numbers, but they lack skill. Most guards are 1stor 2nd-level warriors. While the guards have access to the Redcloak Battalion, this is supposed to be a true weapon of last resort, and a commander who calls them into service will be humiliated and potentially chastised. Likewise, most commanders are loathe to bring the King’s Citadel into their investigations. As a result, most of the Watch commanders look for a few talented independent operators who can quietly solve problems and get things done—basically, a party of capable adventurers.

Breland adheres to the Galifar Code of Justice. Currently, the protection of the law is extended to all citizens of the 12 nations recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold and all members of the dragonmarked houses. This notably excludes Droaam and the Shadow Marches, although Marchers or Droaamites in the employ of House Tharashk are protected. As a result, creatures from Droaam are not protected by the law unless they are working for House Tharashk. All beings are expected to abide by the laws of the city, so while there is technically no legal penalty for killing a Droaamite gnoll, the gnoll is held accountable if he murders a Brelish citizen.

Undead are also excluded from the protection of the law, regardless of whether or not they are intelligent. Once a creature has died, he no longer has any status in the eyes of the law.

The warforged are protected due to rights granted them by the Treaty of Thronehold, but getting the representatives of the law to always enforce this protection is tricky.

### Crimes

#### Identification Papers
In Sharn, it can be very important to have identification papers, a laborer’s license, or traveling papers—some proof of residence and citizenship. When a character is apprehended as a suspect in a crime, the sergeant of the Watch demands to see identification. For many minor crimes, the sergeant makes a note of the crime on the paper and assesses a fine based on the number of previous offenses.

If the character does not have any form of identification, the Watch treats him with considerable suspicion. Fines are usually increased to five times the basic amount, on the assumption that the character is a repeat offender, and the character might be held at the garrison while the matter is investigated further.

There are any number of people in Sharn who sell false identification papers (using paper notarized by corrupt heirs of House Sivis), so it is certainly possible to leave a criminal past behind— though possession of forged identifi cation is itself a crime.

#### Crimes of Aggression
##### Assault and Battery
The consequences of unarmed brawling depend on class. In lower class districts, the law completely ignores brawling. An innkeeper may throw a rowdy barbarian out of the inn, but the guards simply don’t have time to follow up on every bar fight.

In a middle-class neighborhood, the consequences depend on who is involved in the fight. If two laborers get into a fight, the guards don’t care—but if a seedy adventurer punches a respectable barrister, that’s another story. Officers of the Watch break up any fight involving respectable citizens. This is a minor offense that can be handled by a sergeant of the Watch. A mark is made on the identifi cation papers of the guilty party. He is fined **5 sp for each assault charge shown on his papers.** Finally he is escorted out of the district and ordered to stay away for at least one day. If the character doesn’t have gold or identifi cation papers, he is taken to the local garrison and assigned to labor detail. Generally guards do not investigate any sort of assault that they did not personally observe.

An upper-class district follows the same guidelines as middle-class. There are more guards on the streets of an upper-class neighborhood, so a brawl is more likely to be spotted and stopped.

##### Armed Assault
Once people start inflicting lethal damage on one another, a brawl becomes more serious. Guards rarely investigate armed assault in lower-class areas, provided that both parties survived (if not, it’s murder). But they certainly do break up fights that they observe and fine the aggressors. The fine increases to **10 gp per offense**, and **a character with three or more marks on his record may be sent to the garrison and held for trial**. **It is also common policy to confiscate the weapon of the aggressor**, which could be a far more serious loss to a high-level adventurer.

##### Assaulting an Officer
Attacking an agent of the law is always a bad idea, and **anyone captured after such a battle is held for trial**.

##### Murder
Murder—the theft of life—is a serious offense. A murderer who is taken by the Watch is held for trial, and **execution is certainly a possible punishment**. However, this assumes that anyone reports the crime, and that the guards consider it worth the time to investigate. Self-defense is a strong mitigating factor; if the party is attacked by a group of Daask gnolls and kills them, the Watch won’t try to track them down and hold them accountable. Likewise, the identity of the victim plays a major role in determining punishment. The murder of a city councilor likely results in execution; the death of a goblin gambler probably never reaches court.

##### Dueling
There is a long tradition of dueling in Khorvaire, especially in Karrnath and Thrane. In adventurers’ quarters, duels are taken quite seriously; people help the combatants find a safe place to duel, and people who refuse what is seen as a valid challenge suffer a signifi cant loss of face in the district. Most duels are fought to first blood (10% of a duelist’s hit points) or until a combatant chooses to yield, but duels to the death are not unheard of.

However, the Galifar Code of Justice provides no exceptions for dueling. The Sharn Watch considers duels to be assault with two guilty parties, potentially armed assault or even murder depending on the nature of the duel and whether it is interrupted in time.

While most duels are centered on combat, duels based around displays of skill or magical prowess also occur. Thieves may select a single wealthy target and see who can steal the richest jewel without being noticed.

#### Crimes of Deception
##### Forgery
Counterfeit coins and false identifi cation papers are the most common forms of forgery, but there are many others. For minor offenses, a guard simply confiscates the counterfeit goods and applies a fine with a value appropriate to the damage caused by the crime. Using **forged identification papers carries a standard fee of 10 gp**. Participation in a counterfeiting ring or forgery of a more serious nature results in the character being held for trial, with major fines, branding, and exile as possible punishments.

##### Fraud
Technically, fraud is “deliberate deception with the intent to cause injury to another.” This covers a wide array of crimes, from oath breaking to selling false goods to what the Galifar Code of Justice calls “Counterfeit of Identity with Criminal Intent”— a charge typically brought against changelings.

There are a few factors that determine the degree to which the Sharn Watch pursues a fraud investigation. First, how much damage was done? The guards won’t bother with a charlatan selling supposed beholder eggs for 5 cp apiece, but a false alchemist selling worthless “healing potions” for 750 gp may run into trouble. If some form of concrete damage cannot be shown, the case certainly won’t be investigated.

The next questions that need to be answered are where the crime took place and who was involved. Scams that occur in the lower wards are rarely investigated; people who stay in Dragoneyes or Hostelhome are asking for trouble. And as is usually the case in Sharn, the guards typically protect the wealthy at the expense of the poor.

Cases of fraud generally need to be resolved in court; fines, branding, or exile are the usual punishments.

##### Slander
Currently, slander is not a crime under the Galifar Code of Justice. If a bard pens a satirical song about Kalphan Riak, he won’t have a lawsuit on his hands, though he might have to deal with the wrath of the merchant prince.

#### Crimes of Property
##### Theft
Theft is the most common form of crime in Sharn. It’s said that every minute someone picks a pocket or cuts a purse, though this is undoubtedly an exaggeration. For minor offenses where the stolen property is returned, the thief must pay the victim twice the value of what he stole. If the item cannot be returned, the fine may rise as high as ten times the value of the item that was lost, with hard labor if the fine cannot be paid. Branding and exile are common punishments for repeat offenders.

##### Smuggling and Contraband
Characters who sell or possess prohibited goods can find themselves in trouble with the law. Typically, contraband goods are confi scated and the criminal is ordered to pay a **fine of up to twice the value of the contraband**. Large smuggling operations may result in greater fi nes, along with branding and exile.

##### Treasure Hunting
Under the Galifar Code of Justice, it is illegal to plunder and sell the relics of past civilizations for personal gain. So, treasures recovered from Xen’drik, the Depths, or similar locations are actually contraband goods, and the Wharf Watch searches all vessels returning from Xen’drik for treasures.

There are a few ways that adventurers can avoid having their hard-won treasures confiscated. If they wish to work within the law, they can purchase a letter of marque from the Wharf Watch. A letter of marque costs 500 gp and lasts for one year. A letter of marque covers a single region, such as Breland or Xen’drik.

When an adventurer attempts to sell recovered goods or passes through customs, he must produce a valid letter of marque for the region where he obtained the recovered goods. Characters who wish to keep these treasures must purchase a record of legal acquisition, a notarized resilient document that provides a brief description of the object and its owner; a single record can describe up to six different objects.

The need for letters of marque is one reason that adventurers may seek patrons to sponsor their expeditions; Morgrave University has standing letters of marque for almost anywhere adventurers might go. However, an adventurer could choose to avoid the law altogether. Fences throughout Cliffside and the city are happy to make contraband treasures go away, and a good forger can produce letters of marque at a far more reasonable price (typically 25 gp). An adventurer found using forged letters of marque is fi ned 1,000 gp and blacklisted by the Wharf Watch, which prevents him from acquiring letters of marque in the future.

#### Misuse of Magic
The Galifar Code of Justice includes strict guidelines for the use of magic, as laid down by the Arcane Congress in ages past. These include the following:
- Use of any spell that can inflict physical harm on another being—from magic missile to finger of death—is considered to be armed assault. This includes spells that permanently incapacitate a target, such as flesh to stone. Careless use of fire magic is treated especially harshly, due to the significant threat of property damage. If a summon spell conjures a dangerous creature that harms another person, the conjurer is liable for the actions of the beast.
- Spells that incapacitate a target—such as sleep— are treated as simple assault.
- Spells that tamper with the thoughts of another being—charm person, suggestion, fear—are considered to be a form of fraud.
- There are also a few more obscure laws. House Ghallanda has the sole right to make use of heroes’ feast or Leomund’s secure shelter within the city limits. Rope trick and Leomund’s tiny hut can only be used in private rooms. Knock can only be used by or on behalf of the legal owner of the locked item.
- The problem with magical crimes is that the burden of proof falls on the accuser. Can she prove that she was charmed? The Blackened Book only investigates high-profi le cases that have resulted in major damages. Otherwise, if spell use cannot be proven, the crime is not prosecuted.
- The forces of the law are authorized to use any form of magic in pursuit of their duties.

#### Treason
The accusation of treason against the Brelish Crown or the city of Sharn is a serious matter. The Guardians of the Gate handle the investigation of treason, and the King’s Citadel generally becomes involved if the accusation is serious. Treasonous behavior can include:
- Conspiracy to harm a city official or member of the Brelish Parliament or Royal Court.
- Conspiracy to steal or damage property of the Crown or the government of Sharn.
- Espionage on behalf of a foreign government

While these are the most common categories, the agents of the King’s Citadel can extend the umbrella of treason to cover any activity they see as threatening the security of Breland. Crimes of Treason are tried under the authority of the King’s Citadel, without access to a jury. Depending on the magnitude of the crime, treason can result in exile, indefinite imprisonment, or even execution.

### Forces of the Law

Initially, all branches of the Watch receive descriptions of the characters. The inquisitives employed by the Watch use Investigate, Urban Tracking, and their network of contacts to try to identify and locate the fugitives. For major crimes, experts from House Phiarlan or House Tharashk are brought in and scrying or locate creature are employed.

#### Sharn Watch
The Sharn Watch and its subordinate branches have the authority to enforce the laws of Breland throughout the city of Sharn. It is quite possible that the party is too powerful for a Watch patrol to engage and defeat. Initially, patrols that encounter fugitives call on the criminals to surrender; resisting arrest adds to the severity of the charges. If the Watch does not have the power to bring fugitives to justice, more powerful forces are brought to bear. Even in times of crisis, most commanders prefer use personal agents to quietly resolve situations as opposed to bringing in the Redcloaks or the King’s Citadel.

The sentinels of the Watch patrol the streets of Sharn, ever vigilant for signs of unrest. Unfortunately, the Sharn Watch is riddled with corruption, from the commanding officers down to the patrols. There are a few dedicated guards who truly want to protect the innocent. But bribery runs rampant, and the watch has a way of never showing up at the same time as Daask or the Boromar clan. And aside from the general problems of greed, cowardice, and corruption, the watch commanders focus their forces on protecting the wealthy and powerful citizens of the city. The lower levels of the towers are lightly patrolled, while the only guards seen in the Cogs are assigned to specific locations that are vital to the welfare of the city.

The central administration of the Sharn Watch is housed in the Citadel, the hulking fortress in Ambassador Towers that contains the Sharn Prison and the headquarters of the King’s Citadel. The bulk of the Watch is divided up between four garrison districts: [[Upper Dura#^2a9e00|Daggerwatch]] in Upper Dura, [[Middle Menthis#^a2070d|Warden Towers]] in Middle Menthis, [[Middle Central#^7e206a|Sword Point]] in Middle Central, and [[Lower Tavick's#^2f570c|Black Arch]] in Lower Tavick's Landing. Each garrison has its own commander, and these officers have a considerable amount of leeway in how they interpret policy.

[[Lord Commander Iyan ir'Talan]] leads the entire Sharn Watch from The Citadel.

**Watch Patrol:** 2 *guards*
When they patrol the city streets, they typically travel in pairs. A patrol that gets in trouble immediately summons the help of the nearest watch detail.

**Watch Detail:** 1 seargent (*veteran*), 4 *guards*
This is the smallest group of the Watch that responds to a crisis situation—when someone calls for the Watch, a Watch detail arrives.

**Watch Post:** 1 captain (*knight*), 2 elite watch guard (?), 3 *guards*
Guards that are not on patrol are stationed at posts located throughout the city. (Each quarter has at least one guard post.) The exact number of guards present at a post varies depending on the time of day and the location of the post, but the following guards are typical.

##### The Wharf Watch
This Watch division oversees trade and taxation (despite the name, they operate throughout the city).

##### The Cog Guards
This Watch division patrols the reservoirs and most critical areas of the sewer systems.

##### The Goldwings
They are an air cavalry unit who use Vadalis-trained hippogriffs to scout for trouble and to respond to mid-air crimes.

##### The Blackened Book
The Blackened Book is an arm of the Watch trained to track and contain dangerous spellcasters. The mages of the Book may be called in to use *detect magic* to look for traces of mystical foul play, to use *detect thoughts* for difficult interrogations, or *dispel magic* or *counterspell* to contain magic-using insurgents or criminals.

The Blackened Book also keeps track of the most powerful spellcasters in Sharn, and they might approach an experienced PC wizard and deputize the character to assist on a case that exceeds their own skills. The headquarters of the Blackened Book is in the [[Middle Menthis#^a2070d|Warden Towers]] in Middle Menthis, within the garrison of the Sharn Watch.

The commanding officer of the Blackened Book is [[Lady Warden Maira ir’Talan]]. 

Most of the members of the Blackened Book are 4th-level arcane or divine spellcasters. Two notable exceptions are the chief countermage of the Book, [[Warden Balan Cord]], and the lead investigator, [[Warden Hasal Dalian]].

##### The Guardians of the Gate
The Last War endured for a century. During that time, Sharn continued to serve as a center for trade between the embattled nations. But espionage and subterfuge were constant concerns. This resulted in the creation of the Guardians of the Gate, an arm of the Sharn Watch dedicated to monitoring the actions of foreign nationals and immigrants to the city.

While the war is over, the aftermath of the conflict has left the Guardians with many duties. The city has been fl ooded with refugees from across Khorvaire, especially Cyre. This immigrant population has been concentrated in the High Walls district of Lower Tavick’s Landing, and the Guardians have jurisdiction over this district. The Guardians of the Gate also investigate any crimes that are believed to involve foreigners, unless the incidents are severe enough to merit the intervention of the Citadel.

While the bulk of the Guardians are military personnel, the agency also includes a corps of scribes and administrators who handle immigration issues and special customs investigations. The Guardians are an elite unit, and while they are mostly warriors a few members have one or two fighter or ranger levels. The civilian staff includes a few experts and a handful of rogues, who handle the investigation of sensitive matters. Their headquarters is [[Lower Tavick's#^2f570c|Black Arch]] in Lower Tavick's Landing.

The Guardians are commanded by [[Captain Daja Brel]], a career soldier whose family has served with the unit since it was first formed. Daja firmly believes that the Guardians are all that stands between order and chaos, and she acts with draconian force if a situation threatens to endanger the city. [[Lt. Kestran Dal]] is the subcommander of the military arm of the Guardians; if anything, this dour dwarf is even more paranoid than the captain.

Within the civilian branch of the guardians, the senior official is [[Tethyn Olar]], an elderly man who has made a tidy sum from graft and bribery. Guardian Olar follows the letter of the law, but without a little gold to grease the process, the wheels of the system can turn quite slowly. [[Guardian Six]] is the top investigator for the unit. Six is a changeling who spends most of her time in Lower Tavick’s Landing; she maintains half a dozen different identities that help her monitor events. Some of the other guardians distrust her because of her race, but her talents have proven invaluable in the past.

#### King's Citadel
The agents of the King’s Citadel stand above the Watch, and can assume control of any criminal investigation at any time. Members of the Watch are expected to provide agents of the Citadel with their full support. The Citadel generally only takes control of cases involving treason or espionage, but anything that could pose a threat to Breland falls under their domain. The Citadel is concerned with forces that threaten the entire city, or even the kingdom itself. Foreign spies, mad necromancers, ancient fiends— these are the foes of the King’s Citadel.

Of course, many of these threats may be beyond the capabilities of the local agents. Like the Blackened Book, the Citadel keeps a close eye on unusual and talented individuals, and it is quite possible that a party of adventurers might be called upon to assist the Citadel with a dangerous mission. Unlike the Sharn Watch, the Citadel does not ask for help: it demands it. The knights of the Citadel are the representatives of the King of Breland, and any Brelish citizen who refuses to help the Citadel is committing an act of treason. The Citadel is not required to provide any sort of compensation for the services it demands, but an adventurer who wins the respect of the Citadel and becomes a valued ally can certainly benefit from the relationship.

The Sharn headquarters of the Citadel is in the [[Middle Central#^f5d6c4|The Citadel]] in Middle Central, in Andith Tower. That structure also holds the city jail.

The local commander of the Citadel is [[Knight Marshal of the Citadel Sir Banarak Tithon]], renowned as one of the deadliest swordsmen in the kingdom. Tithon’s wife and children were killed by an Aundairian mystical assault near the end of the Last War, and his service to the Crown is all that he has left. Banarak has a good heart, but he is increasingly distant and distracted, and leaves more and more of the daily work in the hands of his subordinates.

Most of the members of the Citadel in Sharn are part of the King’s Dark Lanterns, the intelligence division of the Citadel. While Tithon oversees all Citadel operations in Sharn, the Dark Lanterns are under the direct command of [[Captain Talleon Haliar Tonan]]. The Dark Lanterns in Sharn include 4 5th-level rogues, 1 4th-level bard, 6 3rd-level rogues, and 12 4th-level experts. For the most part, the Lanterns are specialists in observation and investigation, focusing on skills such as Appraise, Disguise, Gather Information, Knowledge (local), Search, and Sense Motive.

A single squad of the King’s Swords occupies Sharn, commanded by Lieutenant [[Eld ir’Zarna]]. Eld’s family has served in the Citadel for generations, and for the most part he is simply following tradition; he has little ambition and usually waits for Banarak or Talleon to provide him with orders. He has eight soldiers under his command—two 5th-level fighters, one 4th-level ranger, and five 4th-level fi ghters.

Finally, [[Lieutenant Zaira Dane]] is in charge of the local branch of the King’s Wands. A devout follower of Dol Arrah, Zaira believes that you cannot have justice without honor. Zaira despises Captain Talleon and believes that his amoral actions are a blemish on the honor of the Citadel, but she lacks the authority to do anything about it. Technically the King’s Wands of Sharn are only supposed to support the actions of the Dark Lanterns, but Zaira often acts on her own in an attempt to battle injustices that Talleon refuses to deal with. For his part, Talleon believes that Zaira is a naïve idealist who wastes time chasing after “evil”—the true work of the Citadel is protecting the crown, and good and evil are luxuries in this line of work. There are six additional members of the King’s Wands—a 6th-level adept, a 5thlevel evoker, a 5th-level diviner, a 4th-level cleric of Aureon, and two 4th-level sorcerers.

#### [[Redcloaks|Redcloak Battalion]]
The Redcloak Battalion is an elite unit that can be employed against major threats to the city. When a situation calls for extreme military force, both the Sharn Watch and the King’s Citadel turn to the Redcloak Battalion. This elite unit fought at the forefront of the Last War, and the bards in Menthis still sing songs of the exploits of Khandan the Hammer and Meira the Huntress. At the end of the war, the battalion was split up, and one unit was assigned to Sharn. Its headquarters sits in the [[Upper Dura#^2a9e00|Daggerwatch]] district in Upper Dura.

The Redcloaks are commanded by [[Captain Khandan Dol]]. Khandan’s lieutenants are [[Meira]]  and [[Molin Kaine]]. 

**Redcloak Strikeforce:** Lt. Meira, 2 soldiers, 1 cleric, 1 countermage

#### The Royal Guard
Sharn only came under attack once during the course of the Last War, and even if the war began again tomorrow it is unlikely that Sharn would be threatened. While the Royal Guard assigned to Sharn was occasionally called out from the city to protect nearby villages, it is largely a ceremonial force; as a unit, the soldiers of the Redcloak Battalion are more dangerous than the entire Royal Guard. However, Dura is an unstable region and on occasion the Guard has been mobilized to support the Watch in suppressing riots. After the fall of the Glass Tower in 918 YK, the Royal Guard played a vital role in stabilizing the region and maintaining martial law in Dura. The Guard’s headquarters is located in the [[Upper Dura#^2a9e00|Daggerwatch]] district in Upper Dura.

Not one to let his forces go to waste, [[Captain Toras Cant]] has a longstanding arrangement with the Boromar Clan and usually supplies the muscle for Boromar operations, in exchange for gold and dreamlily.

While most members of the Royal Guard are lawful neutral, a signifi cant number are lawful evil, and these are the soldiers who usually work for the Boromars. Most of the guardsmen are 2nd-level warriors, but there are 100 3rd-level warriors and a handful of higher-level officers, some of which have fighter levels. When in uniform, guardsmen are equipped with scale mail, a longsword and light steel shield, and either a glaive or light crossbow. When working for the Boromars, the guardsmen are usually lightly armed, though the Boromar Clan could provide them with superior equipment for a special assignment.

**Security Detail:** 1 guard captain, 4 elite guards

#### Dragonmarked Houses
The dragonmarked houses are extranational entities, and a house has the authority to investigate crimes that have damaged its property, members, or interests. However, once a criminal is brought to justice, he must be turned over to the Watch and given a trial in the Brelish courts. House Deneith has a greater mandate; its Sentinel Marshals are empowered to enforce the law across all of the nations recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold.

#### Churches
The churches have limited jurisdiction. The knights and paladins of the church templars of the Silver Flame are allowed to “do battle with inhuman forces of darkness as it is necessary to protect the peoples of Khorvaire.” This is a privilege as opposed to a right, and local law enforcement agencies are not required to acknowledge the authority of the Flame; the exception to this is in the actual churches of the Silver Flame, where the word of the Church Ministry supersedes all local law. Priests and paladins of the god Aureon have no official authority, but they are generally respected by officers of the law and are excellent candidates when the Watch is looking for help.

#### Adventurers
Guard commanders often prefer to use their own agents, and more often than not the Watch hires adventurers to capture adventurers. Most commanders maintain contacts in Clifftop and Deathsgate, and there are many adventurers who appreciate the gold to be gained through bounty hunting.

### Process

#### Minor Crimes
An officer of the Watch can levy fines on the spot, or make the criminal spend a night or two in jail.

#### Major Crimes
The criminal is transported to a garrison and held as a prisoner until trial. A criminal who is considered to be a significant flight risk is taken to the Citadel of Central Plateau, the headquarters of the King’s Citadel and a maximum-security prison. There is no system of bail, but the character is allowed to make arrangements to acquire a barrister.

#### Evaluation
Each of the garrison districts of Sharn contains a courthouse where cases are tried. It usually takes 1d6–1 days for a character’s case to come to the attention of the local magistrate. At this time, the character is brought before the magistrate and placed upon an *eye of Aureon*; the magistrate reviews the facts of the case and asks the witness to confi rm or deny her role in the crime. The magistrate has the power to dismiss the case or to offer a deal to the accused, typically a fine or the option of exile; if the character refuses the offer, the case proceeds to trial.

#### Trial by Jury
Under the Galifar Code of Justice, the courts of Sharn presume innocence, and allow for a trial by jury. Jury members are selected from among the citizens of the ward and serve for a week at a time, earning 1 sp/day for their services. A Brelish jury is comprised of nine people, and the majority rules; a unanimous verdict is not required.

During the course of a trial, witnesses are called to stand upon an eye of Aureon and recount the events surrounding a crime. The barristers for both parties present their claims and appeal to the jury, which makes the final decision. The magistrate then sets a punishment in accordance with the Galifar Code of Justice.

When a witness testifies, he is asked to remove all rings or jewelry, along with anything else that could provide magical protection against zone of truth. The magistrate is advised by a perceptor, a low-level magewright equipped with a pendant of mystic warning; the perceptor monitors the court for any use of magic, warning the magistrate if anyone attempts to use magic to disrupt the proceedings.

### Punishments

#### Imprisonment
Long-term incarceration is rarely used as a form of punishment in Breland. Prisons are primarily used as holding cells, keeping criminals contained until a case can go to trial and a fi nal punishment can be decreed. If a prisoner is deemed too dangerous to be allowed to roam free, she is usually executed; Breland has just emerged from a century of war, and death is a reality of the world. There is only one situation in which an extended prison sentence would be warranted: If the prisoner cannot be allowed to go free and if his death would have major repercussions. A lengthy prison sentence could also occur if a trial fails to resolve doubts about the crime; the magistrate can rule that the accused be detained while a further investigation occurs.

#### Fines
Fines are the most common form of punishment used by the courts of Sharn. The fi ne is based on the nature of the crime, but the magistrate has leeway to raise the amount of the fine to ensure that it actually serves as an effective punishment. For a commoner, a 10-gp fine is crippling; for an experienced adventurer, it is trivial, and the magistrate ensures that the criminal feels the loss. What may hurt adventurers more than fi nes of gold is confiscation of items; weapons, armor, wands, and similar treasures may be taken away if a character is convicted of using them in a criminal manner.

#### Hard Labor
If a convicted criminal can’t afford to pay a fine, he is assigned to work off his debt in a chain gang. There are a number of city-owned workhouses throughout Sharn, including the Bazaar of Dura and the Ashblack foundries. The work is extremely unpleasant, and the prisoner pays off his debt at a rate of 1 sp/day.

#### Branding
Repeat offenders are often marked with a symbol that warns others about their criminal tendencies. In the past, these marks were made with branding irons. In this more civilized age, a House Sivis heir inscribes the mark using a *pen of the living parchment*. Marks are either placed on the forehead or on the back of the right hand, and guards often demand that suspicious strangers remove their gloves and show the backs of their hands. A criminal’s mark causes most law-abiding citizens to have an unfriendly reaction to the character, and he may be refused service at respectable businesses. However, in the bad parts of Sharn a criminal mark is a badge of honor, and other criminals often treat marked men with more respect.

#### Mystical Punishment
The clerics of Aureon may be called upon to use magic to punish wrongdoing. A few spells are often used as punishment.

**Bestow curse** is a common form of magical punishment used against repeat offenders. A –4 penalty to attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks can prove to be a serious setback to muggers, con artists, and pickpockets alike.

**Blindness/deafness** is occasionally used as a form of punishment. Most often blindness is applied to dangerous prisoners who are going to be incarcerated in the Citadel; the magical handicap is simply one more way of preventing escape.

In high profile cases, High Priest Phthaso Mogan may be called in to place a mark of justice on the criminal. This is often used as an alternative to prison when guilt is still in question; if the accused character stays on the righteous path, the mark is never triggered.

#### Exile
Exile is considerably more common than longterm incarceration. Depending on the severity of the crime, the character may be exiled from Sharn or from Breland itself. In either case, the victim is marked with a *pen of the living parchment* to indicate his status, and if he returns after exile he may be executed or sentenced to an extended period of hard labor.

#### Outlaw
A criminal who has proven himself unfit to be a member of society, yet who is not deemed worthy of execution, may be branded as an outlaw. An outlaw is stripped of the protection of the Galifar Code of Justice, and anyone may do anything they like to him without fear of legal retribution. He may be beaten, robbed, or even killed with no consequence. While the status of exile generally only affects the character in one nation, the mark of the outlaw is recognized in all of the Five Nations, and any nation that respects the Galifar Code of Justice looks suspiciously on exiled outlaws. As a result, outlaws usually congregate in Darguun, Droaam, the Shadow Marches, Xen’drik, the Lhazaar Principalities, and Q’barra—nations that either ignore the Galifar Code or that believe a man can overcome a criminal past.

#### Execution
Executions are rare, but the magistrates are always prepared to eliminate a criminal who is seen as posing a serious ongoing threat to the community. Typically, the death sentence is only invoked for murder or treason of the highest degree. Hanging is the standard form of execution, but criminals (notably warforged criminals) have been beheaded in the past.

Adventurers are generally remarkable, highly talented individuals. People in power—city councilors, guard commanders—often keep an eye on skilled adventurers. Such people often have jobs they need done—often shady tasks they can’t afford to be openly associated with—and adventurers seem ideally suited for this sort of work. As a result, a party charged with a crime may be approached by an infl uential personage before trial and given a choice. If they perform the requested task, the slate is wiped clean. If not, the VIP uses her power to ensure that the upcoming trial goes poorly for the adventurers. Shadier individuals—such as [[Councilor Thurik Davandi]] of Upper Menthis or Commander Lian Halamar of Upper Dura—may frame the party as a way of forcing them to perform a special service.

### Prisons
#### Garrison Prison
There are five prisons in Sharn—one in each of the garrisons of the Sharn Watch ([[Upper Dura#^2a9e00|Daggerwatch]], [[Middle Menthis#^a2070d|Warden Towers]], [[Middle Central#^7e206a|Sword Point]], and [[Lower Tavick's#^2f570c|Black Arch]]), and the high-security prison in the Citadel of Central Plateau.

Each prison contains 10 separate cells, each of which can hold 8 prisoners. Spellcasters, monks, or other characters considered to be high escape risks are chained to the wall using masterwork manacles, and suspected spellcasters are usually gagged. Each cell has an iron door and thick stone walls. Typically, a prison is guarded by a 5-person Watch detail.

#### The Citadel
The prison of the Citadel is designed to hold dangerous prisoners for extended periods of time. The first security measure is simple: height. The prison is located at the top of the tower, and there is a 500-foot drop between the entry chamber of the prison and the observation deck below. The only access is via a magic lift that is open on the sides and can hold a maximum of six Medium humanoids. There are four sniper posts 150 feet up from the observation deck, each home to a 2nd-level fi ghter specialized in archery; these snipers have a clear view of the lift and can shoot at prisoners attempting to escape as the lift descends. The lift moves quite slowly—10 feet per round—giving the snipers and guards on the ground a considerable amount of time to prepare or to attack escapees. In addition to the four snipers, the observation deck is guarded by a Watch post and a countermage from the Blackened Book—a 4th-level abjurer equipped with a *wand of dispel magic* and a *wand of force hammer*. A central column in the observation deck includes a crystal ball with telepathy, which is used to monitor the cells of the prison and to communicate with the guards. The *crystal ball* was created as part of the stone column, which is itself fused with the floor of the chamber; it cannot be removed.

The bottom level of the prison contains the guard barracks. Four Watch posts are stationed at the prison, along with another 4th-level countermage, a 5th-level cleric of Aureon (who maintains the *glyphs of warding*), and four Vadalis-trained horrid wolves. At any given time, one of the posts is off duty, while the other three patrol the upper levels. The second level contains the mess hall, recreation area, and bath hall. The third and fourth levels hold the prisoners. There are twenty-five cells on each level, each capable of holding up to four Medium prisoners. The walls are 2-foot-thick stone. All of the doors are locked with *arcane seals*; the doors on the third level are steel, while those on the fourth level are forged from adamantine. The hallways contain *glyphs of warding* holding *blindness* spells.

Spellcasters, monks, and characters considered to be high escape risks are kept in masterwork manacles, just like in the garrison prisons. In addition, the guards have access to ten sets of wizard’s manacles—four each of Small and Medium, and two sets of Large manacles.
