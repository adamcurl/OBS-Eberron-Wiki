[[Northedge]]

## About
Upper Northedge is the perfect place for the noble who can afford a manor in the clouds but wants to avoid the bustle of Upper Central. The districts of Crystal Bridge and Oak Towers are filled with spire-topped manors and grand estates. A host of rooftop parks and gardens provide lovely spaces to sit and reflect.

Shae Lias is arguably the most remarkable district of Upper Northedge. Its population is largely composed of elves, and it is a bastion of Aereni culture and traditions. The heart of Shae Lias is the Gates of Passage, a grand structure that is both the Aereni embassy and a temple to the Undying Court. The priests of the Undying Court don’t share this information with outsiders, but many residents believe that an actual member of the Court—an ancient undead elf possessing vast knowledge and divine power—resides in the temple.

Other points of interest in Shae Lias include the Oaks, one of the finest restaurants in Sharn, which serves food of the highest quality (and priced accordingly). The Veil of Flesh specializes in Aereni body art, in the form of both traditional tattoos and temporary illusions woven directly into the skin. The business known as Nightshade might be the most unusual watering hole in Sharn, doubling as apothecary and tavern; the house specialty is beverages tainted with weak poisons, designed to take the imbiber to the very edge of death.


## Districts

### Crystal Bridge
A peaceful residential district with many wealthy and aristocratic estates.


### Oak Towers
A residential district where housing ranges from comfortable to aristocratic. Construction in Oak Towers uses materials and styles drawn from Aerenal, and the district is home to many of Sharn’s established elf and half-elf families.


### Shae Lias
This district is a bastion for the culture and traditions of the elves of Aerenal. It includes a variety of businesses specializing in Aereni goods, as well as a temple of the Undying Court.


#### Gates of Passage
Built from Aereni densewood, this spire serves both as the embassy of Aerenal and a temple of the Undying Court. Aereni citizens who die in Sharn are interred in the temple crypts until their remains can be transported to Aerenal.


#### Nightshade
An apothecary dealing in exotic herbs and salves, Nightshade is also a tavern specializing in lightly poisoned beverages.


#### The Oaks
A legendary restaurant that serves Aereni and Brelish cuisine. The quality is unmatched, as are the aristocratic prices. Head chef Maza Thadian has maintained the Oaks for over three hundred years, but after her recent appointment as city councilor for Upper Northedge she is often occupied with other matters.


#### The Silver Bough
This establishment deals in arms crafted in the Aereni tradition. This merchandise includes magic items, but woodshaper Tanar Mendyrian takes time to produce his wonders, and only a limited selection is available at any given time.


#### The Winding Root
A marketplace and gallery that showcases the work of elven artisans, including sculptures, textiles, and fine clothing.


#### The Veil of Flesh
This studio deals in Aereni body art and alteration, such as tattoos and cosmetic transmutation.


## NPCs

### Councilor Maza Thadian (elf F LN) 
* Councilor of Upper Northedge. A venerable elf and owner of one of the finest restaurants in Sharn, the Oaks, she fights to maintain tradition but definitely puts the needs of the wealthy ahead of the poor. 
* She is both very rich and very old, and as such is highly respected in Sharn's elven community. She is a major conservative voice in Sharn, working to uphold the status quo and tradition, and she tends to favor the wealthy over the poor. These tendencies are said to be especially strong in regards to those from the worst of the lower wards, and specifically goblins. Though a law abiding citizen for the most part, she is said to engage in subterfuge to defend her political ideals.
