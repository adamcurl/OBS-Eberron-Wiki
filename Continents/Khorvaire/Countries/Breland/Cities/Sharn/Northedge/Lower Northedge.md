## About
Although it’s poverty-stricken, Lower Northedge is a significant step up from the slums of Lower Dura. The people of Lower Northedge don’t look for trouble, and they don’t like it coming to their doorstep. North Market is one of the largest markets in Sharn, though in contrast to the Bazaar of Dura it mostly offers simple, everyday goods.

Lower Northedge has a significant shifter population. The Rat’s Nest is a tavern that caters to shifters, and the Bear’s Rest is an inn run by a family of shifters. Tooth & Nail is an apothecary specializing in the care of fangs and claws. Particularly in the districts of North Market and Stoneyard, shifter children play hrazhak in the streets; this flamboyant sport involves making dramatic leaps and scaling walls.

The Shrine of Fathen the Martyr is an infamous spot in North Market. It is dedicated to a crusading priest of the Silver Flame who uncovered a group of wererats in the early days of Sharn. Fathen was torn apart by the wererats he had exposed, and in his honor the Church of the Silver Flame raised the shrine on this site. It’s said that any lycanthrope that enters the shrine will be forced into its true form. Pilgrims devoted to the Silver Flame come from across Khorvaire to pray at the shrine, but the local shifter population has no love for the pilgrims or the church.


## Districts

### Longstairs
Longstairs is a quiet residential district, and its inhabitants like it that way. The people of Longstairs are primarily human and dwarf commoners, with a few experts and magewrights mixed in. These citizens go out of their way to maintain the stability of the neighborhood, and anything disruptive is quickly met with unifi ed opposition. The apartments in Longstairs are reasonably priced and well maintained. However, adventurers who settle in Longstairs may have to make an extra effort to fi t in; characters that engage in wild antics may be run out of the neighborbood.

**Desc:** Most of the towers in this residential district have stairs that wrap around the outside of the buildings. The people go about their business with quiet determination, and keep a suspicious eye on any strangers.


### North Market
The open market in this region largely deals in simple, locally produced goods. Due to the significant shifter population in Lower Northedge, North Market offers goods and services aimed at shifters (grooming services, claw care, and so forth) as well as those reflecting an Eldeen influence.

The open market of this district is one of the oldest in Sharn. In addition to local residents, crafters from the regions around Sharn come to sell their wares at the open market, and Far and Sar are excellent times to purchase textiles and other crafted goods. A marketplace permit costs 3 sp. Most of the businesses and merchants in the district follow solid, simple trades: blacksmiths, brewers, carpenters, and tailors who produce sturdy clothes for the lower classes.

**Desc:** North Market is one of the oldest business districts in Sharn. The cobblestone streets have been repaved time and again, and the walls of the towers are worn smooth with age. People always fi ll the streets, but there is less noise and bustle than one might expect from such a crowd; the locals are surprisingly patient and polite.

##### The Shrine of Fathen the Martyr
In the early days of Sharn, Lower Northedge contained a strong network of wererats. When the Silver Flame sought to exterminate the lycanthropes, the cleric Fathen was instrumental in identifying the two-legged vermin infesting the city. In the fi nal days of the crusade, Fathen uncovered a nest of wererats in North Market. Fathen was torn apart in the street, but somehow he granted the common citizens the power to bypass the lycanthropes’ resistance to injury and a mob of commoners defeated the creatures. The Church of the Silver Flame raised a shrine on the site of Fathen’s death, and to this day pilgrims come from across Khorvaire to pray at the martyr’s shrine. The shifters of Sharn are still bitter about the crusade, and there is often tension between shifters and followers of the Flame, especially on the day of Fathen’s Fall.

[[Kaira Faine]] maintains the shrine, as this former member of the church templars has grown too old to fi ght on the front lines. A follower of the Silver Flame who visits the shrine can ask Kaira to bless one weapon, or 20 bolts, arrows, or bullets. The priest asks for a donation commensurate with the pilgrim’s wealth, though paladins of the Flame are never required to pay the tithe. The blessed weapon gains the properties of alchemical silver for purposes of bypassing damage reduction. This effect lasts for 24 hours, and a particular individual can only receive the blessing once every week.

Any lycanthrope that enters the shrine must make a DC 30 Control Shape check or revert to animal form. This applies to both afflicted and natural lycanthropes.

##### The Bear’s Rest
A modest inn maintained by an enormous beasthide shifter named [[Leara]], who usually gives a discount to traveling shifters. The decor features various exotic hides. The inn is of average quality and price, but Leara gives a 20% discount to shifters.

##### The Horse and Hearth
Though not as colorful as the Bear’s Rest, this large inn is maintained by House Ghallanda and offers rooms of modest and comfortable quality.

Travelers looking for food, drink, and shelter can fi nd it all at the Horse & Hearth, a large inn and tavern maintained by House Ghallanda. The food and lodging are both of average quality, but extremely reliable. While it doesn’t have the colorful atmosphere of the local shifter establishments, the Horse & Hearth has the reputation of House Ghallanda behind it, and provides all the standard services the house is known for. [[Gaidan d’Ghallanda]] operates the inn. Gaidan possesses the Lesser Mark of Hospitality (purify food and drink, Leomund’s secure shelter), and two of his daughters have the Least Mark (prestidigitation and purify food and drink).

##### The Rat’s Nest
This tavern caters primarily to the shifters of Lower Northedge, and serves food and drink in the style of the Eldeen Reaches. The customers of the Rat’s Nest are more inclined to gossip than to violence; the shifters of Northedge are as industrious and honest as any other citizen of the ward. However, the presence of Fathen’s Shrine hangs over the tavern like a shadow, and the regulars have an unfriendly attitude toward any follower of the Silver Flame.

##### Tooth & Nail 
An apothecary specializing in the care of fangs and claws.


### Stoneyard
This residential district is home to the majority of Sharn’s shifters, including both recent immigrants from the Eldeen Reaches and long-established local families. The district includes a makeshift hrazhak court and a shrine devoted to the Wardens of the Wood. Conditions are poor to modest.

Stoneyard is a peaceful residential district, notable primarily for its signifi cant shifter population and the large number of orchards and parks scattered throughout the region. Shifter children often use the parks for hrazhak matches, swinging through the trees and racing through the grass. A druid named [[Teln]] helps to maintain the foliage and tend to those injured in hrazhak; in exchange for his services, the locals provide for his needs. Teln follows the Gatekeeper tradition, and sends word to the Gatehouse in Skysedge Park if he sees anything disturbing.

**Desc:** Balcony orchards line the exterior towers of this quiet residential district, and small parks are scattered throughout the district. A large number of shifters inhabit the area, and shifter children scamper through the trees with great enthusiasm and agility.
