[[Sharn]]

## About
The Northedge residential area is the quietest quarter of Sharn. At first glance there’s little to attract adventurous sorts, unless someone is interested in purchasing top-quality real estate. At the same time, you never know when this charming and innocuous area could be the site of a nefarious cult or a devilish plot.


## Things to Do:
Northedge is the most peaceful quarter in Sharn. It does have a few taverns and temples, but if you’re looking for excitement or a wide selection of goods and services, you’ll want to go elsewhere. Even so, Northedge boasts some notable special attractions:

* **Settle down.** If you’re looking for a place to live in Sharn, Lower Northedge residences are of reasonable quality and price and offer more security than Lower Dura.
* **Die in style.** The elves of Shae Lias are experts in funerary customs and embalming. In addition, the high priest of the Gates of Passage is capable of raising the dead.
* **Find a patron.** Many eccentric nobles make their homes in Upper Northedge. A patron of the arts could take an interest in the career of a bard or an entertainer. A collector might keep capable adventurers on retainer with the understanding that they’ll deliver any Dhakaani artifacts they come across in their travels. You never know what benefits a patron will provide; at the very least, having a patron can provide you with an introduction to high society.
