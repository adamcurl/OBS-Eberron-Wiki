## About
This ward caters to the middle class of Sharn, offering a wide range of comfortable housing. Dwarves make up most of the population, with the highest concentration in the district of Holdfast. In contrast to the residents of Highhold in Upper Dura, the dwarves of Holdfast have deep roots in Sharn and feel no strong connection to the Mror Holds or its traditions.

High Hope is a temple district; although the city’s most impressive churches and shrines are located in Upper Central, it’s commonly known that if you’re looking for a truly devoted priest, you should go to High Hope. The most notable feature of the district is Daca’s Watch. Twelve feet high, this pillar is thought to have once held a statue or monument. Over a century ago, a gnome named Daca climbed atop the pedastal. She has remained there ever since, and shouts advice to anyone who passes by. Although Daca doesn’t claim to be a priest, the people of the community say that she’s blessed by the god Boldrei and speaks with the Sovereign’s voice. True or not, Daca’s advice has proven to be remarkably sound, and she and her pillar have become a tourist attraction.


## Districts

### High Hope
A center for worship for the people of Northedge, High Hope includes temples of the Silver Flame and the Sovereign Host, along with many smaller shrines. It lacks the grandeur of Sovereign Towers in Central Plateau, but the glory of these monuments is tarnished by the corruption within the churches themselves. High Hope lacks the gilt trappings of Sovereign Towers, but what it lacks in pomp it makes up for with faith and sincerity. In addition to the three primary temples and the three large shrines, there are a wide range of smaller monuments dedicated to other deities and to religious heroes and martyrs. The people who live in the district or who come to High Hope to pray are typically quiet and serious in their devotions.

The councilor of Middle Northedge lives in High Hope. [[Councilor Doran Cantar]] comes from a long line of advocates and mediators. In addition to inheriting the wealth and talents of his family, Doran has a strong faith in the Sovereign Lady Boldrei; while he does not serve as a priest, he draws strength and minor mystical abilities from his faith. Doran often consults with [[Daca]].

**Desc:** Shrines and temples line the suspended streets of High Hope. Compared to the gaudy trappings of Sovereign Towers, High Hope appears plain and functional. However, the temples are large and well maintained, and throngs of devotees fill the streets.

##### Coldflame Keep
 A garrison temple of the Silver Flame, this place once housed a hundred templars dedicated to protecting Sharn from supernatural threats. It has largely been abandoned; only a dozen devoted templars and adepts remain in residence.
 
 While it looks more like a fortress than a place of worship, Coldflame Keep is the local church devoted to the Silver Flame. Established during the Purge as a garrison of the church templars, Coldflame Keep has slowly dwindled as the hierophants have drawn resources away to the temples of Sovereign Towers and Pinnacle. Today, the keep is a shadow of its former self. Flamebearer [[Mazin Tana]] does his best to maintain the temple and serve the community. His acolytes consist of two teenagers and one crippled scribe. The garrison was built to house a hundred soldiers, but currently there are only eight templars in residence, most of whom are 2ndlevel warriors. While these soldiers are supposed to protect the district from supernatural threats, Mazin believes that they have been chosen by the Archierophant to keep an eye on the aging priest—to make certain that Mazin does not try to interfere with the powers that control the Church in Sharn. While he is disillusioned with his superiors, Mazin still believes in the ideals of the Church and does his best to help those in need. If the party needs the aid of a true priest of the Silver Flame, Mazin is one of the few people who can help them.

##### Daca’s Watch
 A gnome named Daca has been sitting on a pillar in Northedge for over a century, offering advice and encouragement. Though she doesn’t claim to be a priest, many believe that Daca is blessed and guided by Boldrei.
 
 High Hope contains an unusual shrine to Boldrei, a monument that has come to be known as Daca’s Watch. A thick, 12-foot pillar of densewood, this structure was supposed to hold a statue of some priest or martyr, but funding for the project evaporated, and the pillar stood empty for many years. One day, a gnome named Daca climbed up to the top and sat down. From this high perch, she watched and studied the people, occasionally shouting advice to people who seemed troubled or distressed.
 
 That was 120 years ago. Daca still sits on her post, watching over her neighbors. While she has no oracular powers, she is very familiar with the people of High Hope and has a great deal of common sense. The inhabitants of the district often come to her for advice or when a mediator is required, and she served as an emotional pillar of the community over the course of the Last War.
 
 While she has no religious training and does not profess to be a priestess of Boldrei, most of the locals believe that she has been touched by the goddess and consider her to be a holy woman. They are not alone in this; a handful of priests from other districts regularly visit High Hope to discuss events in Sharn with Daca.


### Holdfast
Holdfast is the heart of Sharn’s native dwarf population. The ancestors of the Holdfast dwarves helped build Sharn, and many of its people are stonemasons, architects, and smiths. Holdfast dwarves are proud of their Sharn roots and have little interest in Mror customs or traditions.

When King Galifar I’s son, Karrn, invaded the Mror Holds, the dwarf nation was in a state of anarchy and constant clan warfare. Despite the barbaric state of their realm, the dwarves were natural miners and stone masons with an innate talent for building fortifications. When King Galifar decided to rebuild the city of Sharn, he brought in a force of dwarf engineers and laborers from the Mror Holds. Dwarf hands played an important role in the rebirth of Sharn, and as the city grew it developed a sizeable dwarf population. Over the centuries, many dwarves spread across the city, abandoning their ancient roots. But other families remained together, forming a strong dwarf community. In time, they settled in the district they named Holdfast.

The dwarves are extremely loyal to one another. A dwarf born in Holdfast has a thousand friends, and can always find shelter or a meal. Of course, this is a double-edged sword, and old friends or family may ask for help with gambling debts, the Boromar Clan, or any number of other possible reasons.

Some serve as overseers in the vast foundries down in the Cogs, while others are architects or stonemasons. Holdfast also contains smithies of all sorts. Most of the arms and armor of the Sharn City Watch are produced in Holdfast, and anyone looking for masterwork armor can find it in this district. The smiths also look after their own, and if a dwarf of Brelish descent can make a successful DC 10 Charisma check, the cost of any weapons or armor he purchases in Holdfast is reduced by 10%.

**Desc:** Dwarves fill streets of Holdfast, though few have the accent or wear the clothing of the Mror Holds. The ringing of anvils and song of steel on steel can be heard rising from the smithies in the center to the district, and masons pass by with cartloads of stone. The people seem to be very industrious, and reasonably well off.

### Oakbridge
While the majority of the townhouses and apartments in Oakbridge fall into the “average” category, they are of the highest quality within that category. The district is not ostentatious and an Oakbridge address conveys no status on its owner, but the buildings are large, well constructed, and very safe, and the inhabitants are friendly and always keep an eye out for one another. If someone purchases a home in Oakbridge, within a week he has dozens of new friends.

**Desc:** Towers and houses of polished densewood fill this district. While simple in design, the buildings are comfortable and well designed, and the district has been carefully maintained. The streets are quiet and the people are friendly, and after a few minutes, it feels like home.

#### Places of Interest

##### Bright Wind
The people of Oakbridge are generally a social and outgoing group, but the friendliest inhabitants of the district are the members of Milana family, who live in a small, comfortable townhouse they have named Bright Wind. [[Jolan Milana]] is a baker who sells his wares in High Hope, while his wife [[Sarina Milana]] is a seamstress who works out of their home. They have three young children: Jalina (female, 12), Mesin (male, 8), and Jeral (male, 5). Anyone who settles in Oakbridge soon receives a personal welcome from the Milanas. In time, the family may be used as a way to pull a party into an adventure. Perhaps one of the children goes missing or overhears a conversation she shouldn’t have. Maybe Jolan is infected with a Riedran mind seed. Or perhaps this friendly family is hiding a dark secret—a tie to a Radiant Cult or one of the Cults of the Dragon Below.
