[[Northedge]]

## About
This ward caters to the middle class of Sharn, offering a wide range of comfortable housing. Dwarves make up most of the population, with the highest concentration in the district of Holdfast. In contrast to the residents of Highhold in Upper Dura, the dwarves of Holdfast have deep roots in Sharn and feel no strong connection to the Mror Holds or its traditions.

High Hope is a temple district; although the city’s most impressive churches and shrines are located in Upper Central, it’s commonly known that if you’re looking for a truly devoted priest, you should go to High Hope. The most notable feature of the district is Daca’s Watch. Twelve feet high, this pillar is thought to have once held a statue or monument. Over a century ago, a gnome named Daca climbed atop the pedastal. She has remained there ever since, and shouts advice to anyone who passes by. Although Daca doesn’t claim to be a priest, the people of the community say that she’s blessed by the god Boldrei and speaks with the Sovereign’s voice. True or not, Daca’s advice has proven to be remarkably sound, and she and her pillar have become a tourist attraction.


## Districts

### High Hope
A center for worship for the people of Northedge, High Hope includes temples of the Silver Flame and the Sovereign Host, along with many smaller shrines. It lacks the grandeur of Sovereign Towers in Central Plateau, but has an atmosphere of solemn devotion.


#### Coldflame Keep
 A garrison temple of the Silver Flame, this place once housed a hundred templars dedicated to protecting Sharn from supernatural threats. It has largely been abandoned; only a dozen devoted templars and adepts remain in residence.


#### Daca’s Watch
 A gnome named Daca has been sitting on a pillar in Northedge for over a century, offering advice and encouragement. Though she doesn’t claim to be a priest, many believe that Daca is blessed and guided by Boldrei.


### Holdfast
Holdfast is the heart of Sharn’s native dwarf population. The ancestors of the Holdfast dwarves helped build Sharn, and many of its people are stonemasons, architects, and smiths. Holdfast dwarves are proud of their Sharn roots and have little interest in Mror customs or traditions.
