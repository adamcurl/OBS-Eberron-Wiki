## About
Middle Menthis boasts the most diverse population of any ward in Sharn. The Little Plains district is the destination for halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains. Cassan Bridge has a significant population of orcs and half-orcs from the Shadow Marches. Immigrants from the Lhazaar Principalities have settled in the Warden Towers district, which is primarily a garrison for the Sharn Watch. The district of Smoky Towers had a significant Cyran community even before the Last War; now, this area has become a haven for Cyrans wealthy enough to escape the refugee camps of High Walls.

One of the most prominent attractions In Smoky Towers is the Classic Theater. The place lives up to its name by staging only traditional works written before the start of the Last War. Although the Grand Stage in the University district also performs more recent works echoing the classical style, the Classic has a stated policy of not even considering new works.

The Everbright district might be of particular interest to adventurers. A wide assortment of magewrights ply their trade here, and the shops have a good selection of magic items (of common and uncommon rarity). The people of Middle Menthis are law-abiding folk; visitors looking for spellcasters to help with illegal activities or who want to sell stolen artifacts will likely have better luck in Lower Dura.


## Districts
### Cassan Bridge
A mercantile district with goods of modest to comfortable quality. Home to a significant number of immigrants from the Shadow Marches, Cassan Bridge is the place to visit for exotic Marcher herbs and cuisine. Although no buildings need be built on stilts in Middle Menthis, some of the architecture of Cassan Bridge echoes the styles of the Marches as well.

**Desc:** Citizens rush by with their arms full of packages in this shop district. There is a defi - nite foreign element to some of the architecture and the goods for sale, not to mention the people.

### Everbright
This district is a source of magical goods and services. Exotic components, magewrights for hire, common or uncommon magic items—all of these and more can be found here.

Everbright might not be home to the majority of Sharn’s magic item dealers and spellcasters for hire, but it certainly can boast the largest concentration of them in any one district. While magic item dealers in the Central Plateau cater to wealthy collectors, those in Everbright tend to keep a more practical focus, selling items to the people who are most likely to actually use them—adventurers. For this reason, dealers in Everbright are far more willing to buy (and likely to sell) items that are not fully charged or are otherwise partially used up. Similarly, Everbright is the best place to fi nd spellcasters for hire who are 10th level or above—whose talents are rare and in signifi cant demand in Sharn.

While the spellcasters and dealers of Everbright are accustomed to trading with adventurers, they are also (for the most part) law-abiding citizens. Characters who need spells cast with no questions asked are better advised to seek out spellcasters affi liated with Sharn’s criminal gangs rather than walking into a spellcaster’s offi ce in Everbright.

**Desc:** Everbright lanterns keep the towers here well illuminated, and other magical effects are visible everywhere—from soarsleds carrying people through the air to constructs following their masters as they visit different shops.

##### Shrine of the Shadow
Hidden down a dark alley, the shrine of The Shadow represents the dark side of Everbright. Here, necromancers and other evil wizards gather in secret to revere the power of magic perverted to evil ends, led by a cleric/necromancer named [[Thalanna]]. This secretive cult has no grand evil schemes for world domination; they exist purely to worship their patron deity and hide only to escape persecution.

### Little Plains
Founded by Talenta halflings, this district includes a central campground for visiting halfling nomads. The permanent residents are mostly halflings as well. Talentan foods and crafts can be found here, along with displays of traditional skills and pastimes.

**Desc:** The towers here appear insideout: instead of open central spaces surrounded by buildings attached to the outside of a tower, streets run around the outsides of the towers, giving access to very low doorways leading to cavelike interiors. Halfl ings seem to negotiate these outside ledges with ease, and so do the dinosaurs many of them ride. Great winged reptiles soar between towers, many with halfl ing riders on their backs.

### Smoky Towers
Safer than the lower wards and less expensive than Upper Menthis, Smoky Towers has plenty of entertainment options. The Classic Theater is its most popular venue, but Smoky Towers offers a wide variety of more exotic fare. Dinner theater, changeling burlesque, and other diversions can be found in Smoky Towers. Thovanic Hall has begun performing works from Darguun and Droaam featuring monstrous performers. Smoky Towers has also become a haven for Cyran refugees wealthy enough to avoid High Walls.

A small but significant number of people who trace their origin to Cyre have made their home in Smoky Towers. Although culturally they differ little from their Brelish neighbors, this community has become very active in the wake of Cyre’s destruction, discussing rebuilding or reestablishing the nation elsewhere in Khorvaire. The Citadel keeps the Cyran community here under close watch due to this potentially treasonous talk.

**Desc:** Theaters, restaurants, and concert halls offer the promise of an evening’s musical entertainment in this district.

##### The Atrium
The Atrium, a recital hall in Kashik Tower, features an acoustically resonant open performance space with seating for about 300. For performers on the move in Menthis’s entertainment scene, the Atrium is a defi nite step up from most of the dinner theaters in the district, and many of its performers are only a few years away from being ready for the Kavarrah Concert Hall.

##### Classic Theater
A small and inexpensive theater, the Classic performs only works written before the start of the Last War. While the Grand Stage in the University District also performs more recent works echoing the classical style, the Classic has a stated policy of not even considering new works. Every performance in the Classic features archaic language, outmoded social customs, and the idealistic outlook of a world that has utterly vanished from Khorvaire, yet its thousand seats fill up every night.

##### Mizano Rupa’s
Mizano Rupa’s is one of three important dinner theater venues in Smoky Towers that give rising stars a stop on their ascent between Gailan’s and Upper Menthis. Self-consciously named and styled in imitation of Gailan’s in the Torchfire district below, Rupa’s offers decent food and highquality entertainment in a variety of styles. [[Mizano Rupa]] is hardly a connoisseur of fine music, but he knows what he likes and—fortunately—his tastes seem to compare with those of many in Middle Menthis, making his establishment quite popular. Reservations are recommended.

##### Starfire Dragon
The Starfi re Dragon offers a steady diet of entertainment accompanied by exquisite meals. In this case, however, the entertainment clearly takes a back seat to the food. Trying to compete in a crowded market, the Starfire Dragon’s owner, [[Amman Todav]], has hired excellent cooks, and the restaurant’s menu offerings reflect the trouble he has gone to. Todav’s choice in entertainers is less discriminating, however; he lost a good portion of his hearing fi ghting in the Last War, and judges performers more on their looks than the quality of their performances. On a good night, the entertainment ranks with the best Middle Menthis has to offer. But the Starfi re Dragon is gaining a reputation for showcasing a great number of beautiful women with mediocre singing voices.

##### Thovanic Hall
Similar to the Atrium, Thovanic Hall is a former theater converted to use as a recital hall. It is still very new (the renovation was completed only two years ago), and is still trying to build its reputation as a place for fi ne music to compete with the Atrium. As a distinguishing point, Thovanic presents a signifi cant number of non-Brelish and even nonhuman performers, who bring diversity to the musical offerings that the residents of Middle Menthis fi nd sorely lacking in the district’s other offerings.

### Warden Towers
This district is the primary garrison of the Sharn Watch in Menthis. It’s home to a community of Lhazaar immigrants, and the Broken Anchor is a tavern catering to Lhazaar travelers.

**Desc:** Some guards of the Watch march to and fro in groups, while others stand at attention, and still others drill for combat. Shouted commands and marching songs fill the air.

##### Broken Anchor

##### Thuranne d’Velderan’s Investigative Services
[[Thuranne d’Velderan]], a scion of House Tharashk, operates an inquisitive agency in Warden Towers. Her greatest asset is an extensive network of contacts within the Warden Towers garrison, which gives her access to resources beyond the reach of most inquisitives. She specializes in criminal investigation, and frequently consults for the Watch to repay the many favors her contacts have performed for her. She is not particularly favored in House Tharashk, since she prefers to run her own business than take on jobs for the house.
