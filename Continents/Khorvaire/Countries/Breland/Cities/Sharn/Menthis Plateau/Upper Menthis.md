## About
Elegant and civilized, Upper Menthis is home to four of the finest theaters in Breland: the cutting-edge Art Temple, the colorful Khavish Theater, the traditional Grand Stage, and the open-air Stargazer Theater, as well as the Kavarrah Concert Hall.

The shops in Upper Menthis deal mainly in fine food, fashion, and exotic goods. For instance, in the Seventh Tower district, Window on Yesterday, Echoes of the Past, the Mekdall Gallery, and Cloud Antiquities all buy and sell interesting antiques and trinkets from distant lands.

The district of Den’iyas is a gnome neighborhood that provides a glimpse into the culture of Zilargo. Davandi Fine Tailoring is the source of some of the finest glamerweave clothing in Khorvaire, and the district also hosts a number of businesses that specialize in alchemy, illusion, or divination. Visitors should be aware that intrigue is the primary pastime in Den’iyas, and that hapless adventures can easily find themselves pulled into intricate schemes or feuds.

Upper Menthis also contains the University district, home to Breland’s finest institutions of learning. More information about this district can be found in [chapter 1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/erftlw/character-creation-group-patrons#University).


## Districts

### Den’iyas
Founded by gnome immigrants from Zilargo, Den’iyas is a haven for those interested in Zil culture. It’s home to many sages and artisans, and a hotbed of schemes and intrigue.

There are usually a dozen subtle power struggles going on between the major families of Den’iyas, and even the most innocuous event could be part of some elaborate intrigue. Information of all types can be acquired here, but those with secrets must be careful around the inquisitive gnomes, lest they become the object of blackmail, curiosity, or deceit.

**Desc:** The buildings here, from quiet and neat little townhomes to shops and services of all kinds, are scaled for the district’s gnome inhabitants.

##### Davandi Fine Tailoring
In addition to being the city councilor representing Upper Menthis, the gnome [[Councilor Thurik Davandi]] is an accomplished tailor and magewright who produces the finest glamerweave clothing available in Sharn. He also secretly supplies darkweave clothing to the Boromar Clan, and his goods are at least partly to blame for the City Watch’s inability to put a damper on the Boromar Clan’s criminal activities.

##### Khavish Theater
Established by and for gnomes, the Khavish has ample seating for small creatures, and its shows make extensive use of illusions. Two stage troupes share the theater—the Khavish Players, made up mostly of human actors, and the Zilargo Repertoire Group, consisting entirely of gnome performers.

The Khavish Players present more contemporary and widely appealing acts than the performers at the other Upper Menthis theaters, incorporating music, sex, and comedy—though not to the extent of the burlesque found in Lower Menthis. The Zilargo Repertoire Group generally performs works that only interest gnomes, full of intricate histories and a level of detail that audiences of other races fi nd excessive (and mostly boring). Occasionally, they stage a comedy aimed at mixed-race audiences, generally featuring acrobatics and pratfalls. Recently, the famous gnome bard Kessler agreed to play with the Zilargo Repertoire Group, and that has brought more mixed crowds to their performances.


### Ivy Towers
This residential district includes comfortable homes and modest apartments. Many of the students and faculty of Morgrave University live in Ivy Towers.

**Desc:** Orderly collections of townhouses ring the towers of this quiet district. Children play in the streets and couples stroll arm in arm.


### Seventh Tower
A shopping district, with restaurants and goods of comfortable to wealthy quality. Seventh Tower is especially noteworthy for Little Xen’drik, a collection of galleries whose owners buy and sell goods from Xen’drik.

**Desc:** Stores, restaurants, hotels, and a few townhomes in this prosperous neighborhood appear high-priced and lavish.

#### Places of Interest

##### Galdin’s Garden
By general consensus, one of the fi nest restaurants in Sharn is Galdin’s Garden. An elegant setting for a fi ne meal situated at the top of Seventh Tower, a garden of exotic and fragrant fl owers, particularly roses and orchids, surrounds the establishment. Both indoor and outdoor seating is available, and some of the tables offer views of the distant ocean to the south on (the relatively rare) clear days. The menu consists of spicy Brelish offerings, while the wine list includes the best vintages from the Eldeen Reaches and Aundair.

##### Little Xen’drik
This area of small shops deals in antiquities and relics recovered from Xen’drik and the ruins below Sharn.

**Mekdall Gallery** deals in ancient elven and drow goods. It is run by [[Jaster Mekdall]], who is gloomy and frequently moans about being cheated by his customers, but he charges decent prices.

**Echoes of the Past** deals in magic items with practical uses. [[Haga Wissel]] runs it and is cheerful and friendly but extremely hard-nosed about prices. She has been accused of having connections to House Tarkanan and even paying burglars to steal items from other collectors.

**Windows on Yesterday** looks for items with historical significance. [[Kidro Osanak]] runs it. A wizened old gnome, Kidro harbors a deep resentment toward Haga Wissel, and though he can’t prove it, believes that she has stolen items from his shop. One of the only dealers in Little Xen’drik with more interest in the historical knowledge contained in his treasures than in their monetary worth, Kidro often sponsors the most challenging expeditions.

**Postar’s Jewelry Art Gallery** specializes in the adornments of ancient Xen’drik. [[Biballin Postar]] runs it and is absent-minded and keeps completely irregular hours, but can be counted on to pay the best price for jewelry related to either the drow or the giants of the ancient and mostly forgotten kingdoms.

**Cloud Antiquities** specializes in giant artifacts and focuses on the aesthetics of the items. [[Reina Doiran]] runs it and is flamboyant and eccentric, she judges items quickly based on her own aesthetic sense rather than their historic value, and pays more for items that intrigue and appeal to her than for dusty trinkets of more scholarly worth.

**Doiran Gallery** also specializes in giant artifacts, but focuses more on the practicality and history of the items. Reina’s twin sister, [[Fista Doiran]] owns the shop (which once belonged to their parents) and has the opposite personality and artistic disposition. This allows them to get along amazingly well, and the twins cooperate in business dealings despite a strong sense of rivalry.

### University
This district is dominated by Morgrave University. It’s also a nexus for sophisticated entertainment, including the Art Temple, the Grand Stage, and the Great Hall of Aureon.

From Morgrave itself to the businesses that have sprung up around it, love of learning coexists with love of earning and the two feed happily off each other. If scholarly interest can lead to great profi t, or thirst for gold to historical discovery, then the residents of the University District are doubly satisfi ed.

**Desc:** Students carrying armloads of scrolls and books hustle to classes, while others sit or stand in circles, discussing the day’s lessons.

#### Points of Interest
- Path of Light shrine

##### Art Temple
One of Upper Menthis’ four theaters, the Art Temple is famous for cutting-edge, avant-garde plays. It has no resident playwright; instead, the theater solicits submissions from across Khorvaire, though residents of Sharn pen most of its productions. The theater’s owner, [[Cassa Faer]], prides herself on discovering new talent, but she defi nitely gives preferential treatment to her personal acquaintances, and tends to become romantically involved with each new playwright whose play she produces.

##### Golden Horn
This wealthy inn includes a library, a few large meeting rooms, and a small concert hall. Performing at the Horn is an excellent opportunity for aspiring bards.

This upscale inn is the local outpost of the [[Circle of Song]]. It has a considerable area set aside for members of the Circle, including a library, meeting hall, and even a small concert hall. The proprietor of the Horn is a man named [[Mandyran]]. A former wanderer, the old man has settled down and opened the inn to help support the Circle.

##### Grand Stage
This stage hosts grand performances of the beloved classics of Galifar, along with more modern works that follow classical traditions.

Another of the theaters in Upper Menthis, the Grand Stage generally produces a more conservative and traditional repertoire than the others, including a mixture of classic works and more modern plays echoing the style and conventions of the classics. The well-beloved The *Changeling’s Prophecy*, by the ancient playwright Duthic Olan, appears on the Grand Stage’s docket every two to three years. This is not the place to see avant-garde productions that wrestle with existential concerns in the wake of the Last War, but rather the Grand Stage presents a constant selection of the great cultural heritage of Galifar.

##### Kavarrah Concert Hall
The grand auditorium near the University, Kavarrah Concert Hall hosts the fi nest musical performances in Sharn. Residents of Upper Central, Upper Northedge, and Upper Menthis’s Platinate district attend shows in Kavarrah dressed in their fi nest glamerweave garments, often arriving by skycoach after dining in Skyway restaurants.

##### Haftak’s Books and Binding
[[Haftak ir’Clarn]] runs this bookstore and bindery, and uses its facilities to publish the Sharn Inquisitive, the city’s local chronicle. A minor member of one of Breland’s noble families, Haftak has a prominent cousin in the parliament and a signifi cant fortune at his disposal, which allowed him to start the Inquisitive as a sideline to his marginally profi table main business.

##### Sharn Opera House
Breland has a long heritage of operatic composition, and the Sharn Opera House is committed to regular performances of classic Brelish works, as well as newer material from across Khorvaire. The opera house consists of a grand auditorium in Dalannan Tower, with comfortable seating for 3,000 people. As with the Kavarrah Concert Hall, attending performances in the Sharn Opera House usually become very formal affairs, but the opera house also offers standing-room galleries for those of less wealthy means.

##### Stargazer Theater
Another of Upper Menthis’s four theaters, the Stargazer Theater is located on the top of Kelsa Spire, open to the sky. A grassy park surrounds the open-air amphitheater, allowing audience members to picnic on the lawn if they prefer. Once confined to the summer months, its performance season was extended to the whole year thanks to the weather-controlling powers of House Lyrandar. Now, audiences can enjoy the warmth of a spring or summer day whenever they visit the Stargazer. Its repertoire focuses on classics with family appeal.

##### Morgrave University
The University itself fills Dalannan Tower, which is crowned by the enormous dome of Lareth Hall. Five slender spires ring Dalannan Tower, representing and named after the Five Nations, and they house most of Morgrave’s students. The university library is located just below Lareth Hall, and the Commons—atop Breland Spire—is a popular gathering spot for students and faculty alike.

At the heart of Sharn’s Morgrave University is a sharp dichotomy: On the one hand, it is known as a nexus for scholars wishing to study Xen’drik, thanks in large part to Sharn’s proximity to the secret continent. Its collections of artifacts and scholarly works about ancient Xen’drik and the Dhakaan Empire are unparalleled. In many ways, it lives up to the shining vision of its founder, Lord Lareth ir’Morgrave, to be “a beacon of knowledge shining from the tallest towers of the city.”

On the other hand, the university’s reputation is tainted by allegations of smuggling, treasure hunting, and profiteering. Many priceless relics recovered from Xen’drik or Dhakaani ruins have disappeared from the university vaults and found their way to the black market or into the hands of the Aurum. It’s an open secret that some scholars, professors, and even students at the university have ties to smugglers and thieves. All these allegations, too, have ties to the university’s founding: Lord Morgrave himself is said to have made his fortune selling Dhakaani artifacts on the black market, and some have claimed that the true purpose of the university was to help him build his fortune through such questionable means.

**The Bridge**
The long, arcing, covered bridge that connects Breland Spire (and the Commons) to Dalannan Tower serves as a center of student life at Morgrave. Shops line one side of the bridge, including bookstores, paper makers, clothing and equipment vendors catering to students, and related businesses. Notices, such as announcements of campus events, job opportunities, items for sale, rooms for rent, and the like, cover the opposite wall of the bridge.

**The Commons**
Pleasantly situated atop Breland Spire, the Commons is a large open-air plaza with a commanding view of the neighboring towers and lower reaches of the city. Every morning, vendors wheel their carts up to the Commons and offer a mouth-watering variety of food from a dozen different cuisines, from Karrnathi sausage to Talentan kebabs. The offerings are hardly haute cuisine, but they are authentic and generally delicious.

**Dezina Museum of Antiquities**
Attached to Morgrave University, this building displays the relics recovered on the university’s many expeditions.

Dezina Museum fi lls many of the mid-levels of Dalannan Tower. Its collection would be even more impressive were it not for the strong tendency the University has to sell valuable artifacts rather than put them on display, not to mention the steady stream of items routinely stolen from the museum. More interesting (at least to some) than the museum’s displayed collection are its vaults, vast rooms below the publicly accessible areas of the museum that contain unopened crates of treasures waiting to be cataloged, shelves of artifacts deemed uninteresting, and a few secret rooms holding items too important or dangerous to put on public display.

**Great Hall of Aureon**
Sharn’s largest temple to the Sovereign Aureon, the Great Hall celebrates knowledge and learning. The clergy are sages and savants in a wide variety of fields.

The grand temple to the god of knowledge at Morgrave University, the Great Hall of Aureon is an architectural marvel as well as a sacred site often visited by pilgrims. Scholars, scientists and artifi cers, and any others who seek knowledge have made a practice of spending the night in the Great Hall. They believe that inspiration will visit them while they sleep on the marble fl oor of the majestic temple. Some of Breland’s greatest minds through the ages have claimed that their greatest breakthroughs came after a night in the temple. [[Merrix d’Cannith]] (the grandfather of the current head of House Cannith in Sharn) attributed the invention of living constructs (the fi rst warforged) to stay in the Great Hall of Aureon.

The Great Hall also provides a place to fi nd experts in all fi elds. The temple staff represents the broad spectrum of scientifi c study, and if they do not know the answer to a question they can almost certainly fi nd someone who does. The ordained clergy of the Great Hall include experts, wizards, loremasters, and bards, as well as clerics, and position in the hierarchy of the temple has nothing to do with character class or fi eld of expertise.

**Lareth Hall**
Named after the founder of Morgrave University, Lareth Hall holds the University’s administrative and faculty offi ces. This large domed structure at the center of the campus, situated at the top of Dalannan Tower, contains the office of president [[Larrian ir’Morgrave]], along with the bursar’s and registrar’s offices, and—in a large chamber at the top of the dome—the abode of [[Flamewind]], a gynosphinx.

**Morgrave University Library**
Centrally located on the University campus near the top of Dalannan Tower (just below the dome of Lareth Hall), the Morgrave University Library has the most extensive collection of books in all of Breland. It pales in comparison to the great library at Korranberg, but a signifi cant number of Zilargo expatriates live in Den’iyas and work to make the Morgrave Library the best resource it can be.

History is clearly a specialty of the University, and those using the Morgrave Library for research into the history of Sharn or Xen’drik gain advantage on history or investigation checks.

Those without formal ties to Morgrave University must pay a fee of 1 gp per day to conduct research at the Library. Students, alumni, and those working for Morgrave can use the Library for free.

**Shava House**
Shava House, a small academic community on the campus of Morgrave University, was originally a housing unit for professors with no families. It has developed into more of an intentional community: the residents share meals heavily laden with academic discourse, and generally share an interest in the history of Xen’drik. An unassuming member of this commune is [[Dala Arand]] —a friendly scholar active in planning expeditions to Xen’drik, while also secretly serving as a spy for the [[Order of the Emerald Claw]].
