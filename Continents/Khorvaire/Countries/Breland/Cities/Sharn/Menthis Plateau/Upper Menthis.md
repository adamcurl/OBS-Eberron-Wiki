[[Menthis Plateau]]

## About
Elegant and civilized, Upper Menthis is home to four of the finest theaters in Breland: the cutting-edge Art Temple, the colorful Khavish Theater, the traditional Grand Stage, and the open-air Stargazer Theater, as well as the Kavarrah Concert Hall.

The shops in Upper Menthis deal mainly in fine food, fashion, and exotic goods. For instance, in the Seventh Tower district, Window on Yesterday, Echoes of the Past, the Mekdall Gallery, and Cloud Antiquities all buy and sell interesting antiques and trinkets from distant lands.

The district of Den’iyas is a gnome neighborhood that provides a glimpse into the culture of Zilargo. Davandi Fine Tailoring is the source of some of the finest glamer­weave clothing in Khorvaire, and the district also hosts a number of businesses that specialize in alchemy, illusion, or divination. Visitors should be aware that intrigue is the primary pastime in Den’iyas, and that hapless adventures can easily find themselves pulled into intricate schemes or feuds.

Upper Menthis also contains the University district, home to Breland’s finest institutions of learning. More information about this district can be found in [chapter 1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/erftlw/character-creation-group-patrons#University).


## Districts


### Den’iyas
Founded by gnome immigrants from Zilargo, Den’iyas is a haven for those interested in Zil culture. It’s home to many sages and artisans, and a hotbed of schemes and intrigue.

In addition to being the city councilor representing Upper Menthis, the gnome Thurik Davandi is an accomplished tailor and magewright who produces the finest glamerweave clothing available in Sharn.


#### Khavish Theater

#### [Morgrave University](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/erftlw/character-creation-group-patrons#MorgraveUniversity)
At the heart of Sharn’s Morgrave University is a sharp dichotomy: On the one hand, it is known as a nexus for scholars wishing to study Xen’drik, thanks in large part to Sharn’s proximity to the secret continent. Its collections of artifacts and scholarly works about ancient Xen’drik and the Dhakaan Empire are unparalleled. In many ways, it lives up to the shining vision of its founder, Lord Lareth ir’Morgrave, to be “a beacon of knowledge shining from the tallest towers of the city.”

On the other hand, the university’s reputation is tainted by allegations of smuggling, treasure hunting, and profiteering. Many priceless relics recovered from Xen’drik or Dhakaani ruins have disappeared from the university vaults and found their way to the black market or into the hands of the Aurum. It’s an open secret that some scholars, professors, and even students at the university have ties to smugglers and thieves. All these allegations, too, have ties to the university’s founding: Lord Morgrave himself is said to have made his fortune selling Dhakaani artifacts on the black market, and some have claimed that the true purpose of the university was to help him build his fortune through such questionable means.

#### Stargazer Theater
