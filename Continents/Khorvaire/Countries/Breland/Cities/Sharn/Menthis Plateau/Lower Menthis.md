## About
Providing cheap entertainment for the masses, Lower Menthis is crowded. The Firelight district is filled with sketchy taverns and theaters ranging from the innocent to the risque, as well as gambling halls, brothels, and spontaneous performances in the streets.

Lower Menthis is also home to the Burning Ring, a fight club where spectators bet on amateur gladiators. Technically illegal, the Burning Ring moves around the ward. Competitors are armed but unarmored; matches continue until a contestant yields, but fatalities do happen.

## Districts

### Center Bridge
Center Bridge tries to be a quiet residential district, but with Torchfi re and Firelight on one side and Downstairs on the other it can’t help but smolder with seedy activity. Its residents include a number of people associated with Morgrave University, since it is located directly below the University District and it offers much cheaper housing than can be found in the ward above. In fact, groups of students share inexpensive housing here, so close to the illicit pleasures of Lower Menthis, and are responsible for much of the rowdiness that sometimes disturbs the peace of Center Bridge.

**Desc:** Orderly collections of townhouses ring the towers of this district.

### Downstairs
The Downstairs district is primarily known for food and drink. Though most of its taverns and inns are only modest in quality, the Four Sails serves some of the finest seafood in Sharn. The recent success of the Diamond Theater has also drawn travelers to the district.

Situated on the western end of the plateau, separated from Torchfi re and Firelight by the residential neighborhood of Center Bridge, Downstairs is nevertheless a rowdy district. Most of its businesses are taverns rather than fi ne restaurants (though there are exceptions), and drunken revels are the norm every night. Carousers fi nished with an evening at the theater in Torchfi re or even the upper wards, or fresh from different kinds of activities in Firelight, come Downstairs to cap off the night.

**Desc:** By night, inebriated revelers stumble forth into the crowded streets from dozens of taverns. By day, this district is a virtual ghost town, with only cleaning crews, delivery personnel, and the occasional determined drunk livening up the scene.

##### Diamond Theater
A cheap theater once known for bawdy humor, the Diamond has gained fame due to its playwright in residence and has produced several plays about the impact of the Last War.

The Diamond Theater is something new in Lower Menthis—competition for the Ten Torches Theater in Torchfire. With its large stage, copious seating (it seats 1,000 comfortably), and renowned artist-in-residence, the Diamond manages to exude an air of sophistication in a ward all about base entertainment. Luca Syara, the Diamond’s resident playwright, is the hottest thing going in Sharn’s entertainment world at present. Many of her plays wrestle seriously with issues raised by the Last War, exploring themes of nationalism, shattered idealism, alienation and grief, and the search for meaning in a war-ravaged world. For many, such serious, modern plays hold no interest and draw nothing but derision, but even those who hate her still talk about her. Her contract with the Diamond expires in another year, and certain circles buzz constantly with speculation about what upper-ward theater will snatch her up at that point.

##### Four Sails
The Four Sails restaurant is the exception to the general rule of Downstairs that drink comes fi rst, food second. Known as one of Sharn’s hidden dining treasures, regular patrons of Four Sails claim that it has the best seafood in Sharn. Located at the base of Seventh Tower, Four Sails is owned by a Lhazaarite named [[Ulfen Marcrot]], who certainly knows his seafood. Though he prefers not to discuss his past with the tourists and slumming upper-ward residents who come to Four Sails for the dining experience, Ulfen has a colorful history he does enjoy sharing with adventurers. Born and raised a pirate in the Lhazaar Principalities, he took up an adventuring career later in life and has even explored Argonnessen’s coast.


### Firelight
This district is a destination for those who seek illicit forms of entertainment. Many forms of illegal gambling and paid companionship can be found in Firelight. It’s also the most common location of the Burning Ring.

Firelight has somehow managed to maintain a reputation as a socially acceptable place to come and have fun, whatever type of fun one might be interested in having. Crime is much better controlled in Firelight than in the other red-light districts, so customers are less likely to become victims. Changelings control most of the bordellos here, as they do in Dragoneyes, but they employ members of almost all races.

**Desc:** Noisy crowds fi ll taverns, casinos, and bordellos, the sound of laughter spilling out onto the dark streets. A great deal seems to be going on that appears illegal, but everyone seems to be having a good time.

##### The Burning Ring
The Ring offers bloodsport and gladiatorial combat. These dangerous matches aren’t sanctioned by law, and the Burning Ring constantly changes locations to avoid the Sharn Watch. It’s always last seen somewhere in Lower Menthis. Competitors are armed but unarmored; matches continue until a contestant yields, but fatalities do happen. Ideally, the healer on hand for every fight reaches a fallen combatant before he dies, but sometimes the fallen are beyond help. Death only seems to make the crowds cheer louder.

The ringmaster is [[Hoas Junter]], who has extensive connections to the Daask gang. Sometimes his connections help him bring in a monster as a combatant to the crowd’s utter delight. The monster usually wins.

Finding the Burning Ring on any given night requires a DC 16 Investigation/Persuassion/Perception check, which must be made in Firelight or Torchfire.

##### Lucky Nines
The Lucky Nines casino uses a remarkable amount of magic in the decoration and operation of the business. The owner, [[Fasha Yask]], employs a full staff of spellcasters—wizards, sorcerers, bards, artificers, and magewrights—to keep the place running smoothly. Unseen servants attend to customers’ needs, continual flame spells give illumination, illusions provide glamour and glitter, and bouncers with detect thoughts and detect magic patrol the floor to catch those who would cheat the establishment. In addition, as many would-be thieves have discovered, a variety of magic wards protect the place after hours, from fi re traps to guards and wards.

##### Savia’s
The most elegant bordello in Firelight claims that its clientele comes from Upper Central and Skyway as well as closer districts. Its real claim to fame, however, is that its owner, [[Councilor Savia Potellas]], is Lower Menthis’s representative on Sharn’s city council. Her election outraged many of her fellow council members, but she claims to fairly represent the interests of the businesses in her ward, and the merchants of Lower Menthis have never complained about her leadership.

### Forgelight Towers
Forgelight Towers mostly succeeds where Center Bridge fails in being a relatively quiet residential neighborhood amid the rowdy chaos of Lower Menthis. A number of older citizens live in Forgelight Towers, long-time homeowners who established their residence here before the ward became quite so seedy. Many of them are fond of complaining how far downhill the neighborhood has gone; others are more interested in sampling the wares in Downstairs and Torchfire.

**Desc:** Orderly collections of townhouses ring the towers of this quiet district. Children play in the streets and couples stroll arm in arm.

### Torchfire
A district with a notorious reputation, celebrated for cheap entertainment and infamous for its dangerous alleys. Its theaters specialize in musical comedy and lowbrow entertainment, and there are lots of opportunities for hopeful amateurs to get on a stage in Torchfire.

**Desc:** Noisy crowds press into crowded theaters, and the sounds of bawdy music and roaring audiences fill the streets.

##### Gailan’s
Every rule has its exception, and Torchfi re’s reputation for lowbrow entertainment is broken by Gailan’s. The model of the restaurant and dinner theater (copied extensively in Middle Menthis particularly) originated with the innovation of [[Gailan Uthran]], who felt he could put on better shows if the audiences had something to do besides heckle the performers. His idea has clearly worked, and performing in Gailan’s is now the dream of every chorus member in Ten Torches—the fi rst step toward a successful musical career.

##### Ten Torches
The cheapest ticket in Sharn’s theater scene, Ten Torches alternates between lowbrow comedy and bizarre shows that no respectable theater would stage.

The namesake of the Torchfi re district is this crowded, smoke-fi lled theater near the point where Torchfi re, Firelight, and Center Bridge converge. Though critically derided as the bottom of the barrel in Sharn’s entertainment scene, crowds fi ll its hall to bursting every night, thanks to a winning combination of cheap tickets and undeniably entertaining shows. It is sometimes hard to hear the performers over the roaring crowd, but no one seems to care—except perhaps the performers, or the young playwrights with aspirations of writing for the Grand Stage.
