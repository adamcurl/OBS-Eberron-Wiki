[[Menthis Plateau]]

## About
Providing cheap entertainment for the masses, Lower Menthis is crowded. The Firelight district is filled with sketchy taverns and theaters ranging from the innocent to the risque, as well as gambling halls, brothels, and spontaneous performances in the streets.

Lower Menthis is also home to the Burning Ring, a fight club where spectators bet on amateur gladiators. Technically illegal, the Burning Ring moves around the ward. Competitors are armed but unarmored; matches continue until a contestant yields, but fatalities do happen.


## Districts

### The Burning Ring
The Ring offers bloodsport and gladiatorial combat. These dangerous matches aren’t sanctioned by law, and the Burning Ring constantly changes locations to avoid the Sharn Watch. It’s always last seen somewhere in Lower Menthis. Competitors are armed but unarmored; matches continue until a contestant yields, but fatalities do happen.


### Downstairs
The Downstairs district is primarily known for food and drink. Though most of its taverns and inns are only modest in quality, the Four Sails serves some of the finest seafood in Sharn. The recent success of the Diamond Theater has also drawn travelers to the district.


#### Diamond Theater
A cheap theater once known for bawdy humor, the Diamond has gained fame due to its playwright in residence and has produced several plays about the impact of the Last War.


### Firelight
This district is a destination for those who seek illicit forms of entertainment. Many forms of illegal gambling and paid companionship can be found in Firelight. It’s also the most common location of the Burning Ring.


### Torchfire
A district with a notorious reputation, celebrated for cheap entertainment and infamous for its dangerous alleys. Its theaters specialize in musical comedy and lowbrow entertainment, and there are lots of opportunities for hopeful amateurs to get on a stage in Torchfire.


#### Ten Torches
The cheapest ticket in Sharn’s theater scene, Ten Torches alternates between lowbrow comedy and bizarre shows that no respectable theater would stage.


## NPCs


### Councilor Savia Potellas (human F NE) 
* Councilor of Lower Menthis and a bordello owner. Because she is the owner of a brothel, her appointment to the Council of Sharn enraged many of the more conservative council members. Though this brothel is a key to her success, it also forces her to pay money to the Boromar Clan and the Tyrants, two of Sharn's most dangerous gangs.  She hopes to reduce the influence of organized crime in her district, but it’s a dangerous game.
