## About
The aptly named Precarious district in Lower Dura leans out over the edge of the cliffs, and the Skydocks—a system using gigantic arcane cranes and levitation—carry material up from Cliffside and the docks. Precarious is also filled with warehouses that hold these goods. Because Precarious plays an important role in the economy of the city, it’s the only district in Lower Dura where the Sharn Watch maintains a significant presence.

The rest of Lower Dura, in stark contrast, has been left to rot. Ignored by the Watch, it is the domain of gangs and crime lords. The inhabitants of the ward are often protected from violence by their criminal connections or by virtue of having nothing worth stealing, but adventurers ought to tread lightly here, especially those who display the trappings of a wealthy lifestyle.

There was a time when Lower Dura was the heart of Sharn, and remnants of this glory remain. The Silvermist Theater in Callestan was built to entertain nobles. The ward boasted manors, temples, and a garrison for the watch. But all of these edifices were abandoned long ago, and now most are home to nothing but squatters and vermin.

The district of Callestan is a nexus of sorts, where all the major criminal powers of Sharn have a stake. Those groups are described in more detail later in this chapter.

The district of Fallen is a haunted ruin; this temple district was abandoned after it was struck by a falling tower. It’s covered in more detail later in this chapter.

Malleon’s Gate is home to the goblins of Sharn, along with other monstrous immigrants from Droaam and Darguun. The district can be an especially dangerous place for halflings or anyone tied to the Boromar Clan.

Oldkeep and Gate of Gold are wretched tenement districts. A significant halfling community lives in the district known as The Stores, which is also a stronghold for the Boromar Clan.


## Districts

### Callestan
Home to an assortment of squalid and poor businesses, Callestan is a nexus for criminal activity and known as a stronghold of the Boromar Clan.

Until recently, Callestan was a stronghold of the Boromar Clan. The Tyrants and House Tarkanan both conducted business in the district, but the Boromars collected tribute from the merchants, and the fences, dreamlily dens, and gambling halls all owed allegiance to the halfl ing crime lords. Over the last two years, however, Daask has been posing a signifi cant threat to the Boromar position in Callestan. Daask soldiers have beaten and killed Boromar operatives. Businesses with ties to the Boromars have been threatened, robbed, or even destroyed. Tarkanan and the Tyrants have taken advantage of this confl ict to strengthen their own positions, expanding their businesses and contacts in the region.

**Desc:** The inns and taverns in this district are dark and grimy. Vermin run like water through the streets on a stormy day, including rats that scurry into shadows and foul men and women who study you with avaricious eyes.

##### The Broken Anvil Inn
This fading Ghallanda inn struggles to maintain its poor to modest quality. It’s known to be under the protection of the Boromar Clan, which makes it one of the safest establishments in Lower Dura. House Ghallanda operates the inn, and the host is a matronly halfling named Eranna.

##### The Cracked Mirror
A curious tavern owned by a family of changelings, the Broken Mirror changes its appearance and theme every week. In fact, it serves as a front for the Tyrants.

A shrine dedicated to the Keeper is hidden in the basement of the Cracked Mirror, and many of the regular customers participate in secret ceremonies to this deity. The doppelganger [[Zaz]] maintains the shrine. While Zaz gets along well with the Tyrants, her true loyalty lies with the Cabinet of Faces, the mysterious cult of the Traveler hidden in the shadows of Khorvaire. She generally helps the Tyrants, but she often sets her own bizarre schemes in motion.

The owners and staff of the Cracked Mirror appear to change on a weekly basis—one week the innkeeper is a cheerful male dwarf named Mrogab, the next week she’s a surly female half-orc named Traaka. In fact, the staff consists of two doppelgangers (not counting Zaz) and six changelings. These eight take turns playing various roles at the inn and performing work for the Tyrants; they enjoy creating elaborate dramas with these roles, and each trip to the Cracked Mirror should involve colorful new personalities. While the on-duty staff generally assumes the forms of other races, most of the doppelganger or changeling clientele maintain their natural forms while at the inn.

##### The Silvermist Theater
A remnant of Callestan’s glory days, this place is a shadow of the grand establishment it once was. The current owners are known for staging bizarre events at the Silvermist. Since the Sharn Watch stays out of Callestan, anything can happen here.

Officially, Silvermist is a dream parlor secretly owned by the Boromar Clan—a place where illusions and glamers are used for the entertainment of guests. The regular entertainers include [[Jix]], a changeling who uses her natural powers to perform unusual one-woman ballets and operas, and [[Salleon]], an illusionist who fascinates audiences with bizarre and compelling hypnotic patterns. In addition, Silvermist is a dreamlily den—a place where people can buy and use dreamlily without fear of the law.

### Fallen
Formerly known as the Godsgate, this is Sharn’s oldest temple district. Fallen was abandoned after a floating tower crashed into the district during the Last War. Now it’s a collection of wretched ruins.

Some of the temples remained in service, but most were converted to serve as housing for workers in the Cogs. For hundreds of years the district slowly decayed. The final blow came on 9 Olarune 918 YK. The Glass Tower broke apart as it fell, and while most of the floating citadel landed in the Dagger River, some of its spires struck the district of Godsgate, shattering buildings and killing hundreds.

The folk of Lower Dura also talk about that the spirits of the restless dead that haunt the worst ruins of the district, and the mysterious and apparently mad “ravers” who commune with them. Within a year, the district became known as Fallen, and ever since then the citizens of Sharn have shunned it. The ravers inhabit these places, bloodthirsty feral folk who appeared after the disaster. Anyone who seeks the lost treasures of the Glass Tower must face the ravers—and perhaps the restless spirits of the dead. The city council also uses Fallen as a makeshift asylum, throwing the insane into the district, where they either join with the ravers or quickly die.

**Desc:** At first glance, this district looks like a ruin. Huge chunks of stone are scattered around the outer streets. Statues of the gods look down upon you, but many have shattered features or missing limbs. A few buildings and bridges have collapsed, in whole or in part, and most of the surviving buildings show some amount of scarring and damage.

##### The Ravers
They hide in the secret places, scavenging among the ruins where the Glass Tower and Fallen mingle in a jumble of glass and stone. Few ever see the ravers, but the evidence of their passing can be discerned amid the wreckage of old. Whether they were once citizens of the district or some strange breed released from the Depths by the shattering disaster, the ravers have been connected with the Day of Crystalfall and the troubled spirits said to haunt the mournful ruins. Most people never encounter the ravers, but those that do rarely survive to tell the tale.

##### Blackstone Church
There are many shattered temples in Fallen, and the broken statues of the Sovereign Host look down upon the ruins. Only one temple still operates among the ruins—Blackstone Church, Sharn’s first temple to the Silver Flame. Once this church was tended by dozens of acolytes and filled with offerings and relics. Today, dust and shadows hold sway, and a single priest administers to the Flame. [[Faela]], not part of the church hierarchy of Sharn, saw a need and took up residence in the abandoned church. The Silver Flame is dedicated to fighting the evil impulses of humanity as well as supernatural evil, and Faela does her best to counter the darkness she sees in Fallen. She provides nonmagical healing, acts as a mediator, and tries to defuse violent situations. While the people of Fallen don’t always listen to Faela, she is the only priest that has not abandoned them, and they generally look out for her. She devotes most of her time to the poorest and most wretched people of Fallen, trying to help these unfortunates rise up from squalor and make a better life. With her guidance, a number of the worst cases have even managed to leave Fallen and start a new life elsewhere in Sharn.

### Gate of Gold
A squalid slum, providing miserable housing for desperate people. Once home to many of the founding families of Sharn, Gate of Gold is now little more than a slum. Small and wretched townhomes crowd the crime ridden, extremely dangerous district.

**Desc:** The great gate from which this district takes its name was stripped of its gilt plating many centuries ago. Old mansions and towers that once belonged to wealthy lords and merchants have been converted into tenement housing for the poor, and the inhabitants appear lean and hungry.

### Malleon’s Gate
A poor district originally inhabited by goblins, Malleon’s Gate has become a haven for monstrous immigrants from Droaam and Darguun, along with members of Daask.

Sharn was built from the ruins of Shaarat, which was built atop old Duur’shaarat. All of these cities had one thing in common: Goblins. Malleon the Reaver enslaved the goblins of Duur’shaarat and forced them to build his city. King Galifar I offered the goblins freedom in exchange for their service as soldiers and laborers. For many of the goblins, there was little difference between life as a slave and life as a free laborer, but over the centuries some learned valuable trades and established their own businesses. While the goblins were officially citizens of Galifar, few humans enjoyed their company, and they found themselves congregating in Malleon’s Gate.

The Sharn Watch stays out of Malleon’s Gate, but recently the medusa [[Gasslak]] has assumed the responsibility of maintaining order in the district. Gasslak only uses his power to deal with major disruptions; he doesn’t care if a few bugbears throw their weight around. But if adventurers start killing goblins by the score, Gasslak may take personal action or call on Daask to deal with the troublemakers. A few statues scattered around the streets give mute testimony to Gasslak’s power.

**Desc:** Chaos and noise. This district is run-down and filthy. Smoke fills the air and rats scurry in the shadows. Goblins are everywhere, squabbling, haggling, and shouting at one another. A bugbear forces his way through the crowd, flinging goblins aside. A trio of hobgoblin warriors emerges from a tavern and the crowd instantly parts.

##### Bloodstone Inn
A Darguun mercenary troop known as the Ja’khor (a goblin word translating to “Blackbloods”) uses this inn as a base of operations.

### Oldkeep
Another poor slum, largely home to dockworkers from Precarious.

Once, Sharn’s City Watch operated out of a great set of towers and buildings known as the Keep, located in Lower Dura. When the City Watch spread out to Daggerwatch and the new garrisons springing up in other, higher-level districts, a number of land barons bought up the old property and converted it into housing. Now the place is called Oldkeep, in memory of its more glorious occupants.

Most of the residents of Oldkeep work in Precarious, the Stores, or in Middle Dura. Many work for businesses with ties to the Boromars Clan. Recently, bands of monsters with ties to Droaam have begun making surgical strikes in the district— thugs or burglars appear, hit a target with ties to the Boromars, and vanish into the Cogs. The Boromar Clan has hired Deneith mercenaries to patrol the district, but these guards can’t be everywhere at once. While they can handle a few gnolls or even an ogre, these mercenaries have a diffi cult time dealing with medusas or trolls.

**Desc:** Over the course of centuries, old fortresses and garrison halls have been converted into apartment buildings and shelters for the poor.

### Pecarious
The skydocks of Precarious pass goods between the towers and the port on the Dagger River below. The district is filled with warehouses, along with a handful of poor taverns. A small community of Sarlonans lives here.

The skydocks of Precarious lean out into the air high above the Dagger River. Vast mystical cranes and magic lifts use levitation and the power of Syrania to haul loads of cargo and people to and from the waterfront districts of Cliffside. An army of laborers transports goods between the docks and the warehouses in the district—both the massive storage towers and the smaller warehouses. While sailors generally fi nd entertainment in Cliffside, Precarious houses a variety of crafts and services. Mills and workhouses make immediate use of the raw materials brought up from the Dagger River, while a few dingy taverns, gambling dens, and dreamlily dealers provide the workers with a chance to leave their cares—and their silver—behind.

Precarious plays an important part in the economy of Sharn, and as a result the City Watch maintains an active presence in the district. The Watch maintains a small garrison in the area to watch for smugglers—or at least to ensure that the proper bribes are paid. The Watch also protects the tariff offi ce, the large customs agency on the skydocks that handles taxation of goods. The Watch protects trade: petty crimes are not their concern, and Precarious is defi nitely a dangerous place for average citizens and visitors. Tourists and important visitors arriving by ship generally hire a Deneith escort at Grayfl ood to ensure safe passage through Lower Dura to the higher levels of the city.

**Desc:** This district, dominated by massive warehouses that hold the cargo of the merchant ships that ply the Dagger River, consists of storage towers surrounded by tenements, fl ophouses, and an assortment of workhouses and businesses of questionable trade practices.

#### Places of Interest

##### Dar San
While there is little cultural contact between Riedra and Khorvaire, a considerable amount of trade flows across the Barren Sea. Most Riedrans distrust the people of Khorvaire, and over the years a number of Riedran merchants have purchased their own warehouses in Precarious, staffed with Riedran laborers and bookkeepers. Over the last century, a small Riedran community has taken root in Precarious; the inhabitants call in Dar San (“Far Port” in the Common tongue). Though they live in squalor, the Riedrans are a proud people, and the lowliest laborer considers himself to be the equal of a duke of Khorvaire.

Among themselves, the Riedrans observe a strict social hierarchy. When one of the Inspired comes to Dar San, he or she is treated like an emperor. While the Riedrans generally hold the people of Khorvaire in contempt, they have an irrational hatred of the kalashtar and Adarans. The neighborhood has established its own militia—though some might call it a street gang—and any kalashtar or Adaran who comes to the neighborhood gets just one chance to leave peacefully.

Riedrans do not drink alcohol, nor do they use dreamlily or other narcotics; they view such behavior as an example of the corruption that grips Khorvaire.

Dar San features a number of businesses catering to the Riedran community, including the two exotic trades listed in the district description. These include **Kasharath**, a restaurant serving Riedran cuisine; a grocery stocked with Riedran foods and goods; and a shrine to the Inspired. Prominent citizens include [[Lanharath]], who represents the merchant consortium that owns the warehouses; [[Hasalakesh]], a tailor specializing in Riedran clothing; and [[Kantarashtai]], Dar San’s resident healer. Lanharath typically serves as the leader of the community, but the true power rests with the Inspired warrior [[Hamatash]]. Hamatash maintains a low profile, but he is the disposable tool of the Dreaming Dark—if the Dark needs to take some action without revealing the existence of their sleeper agents, they use Hamatash and the Riedran militia.

##### House Kundarak
House Kundarak owns five warehouses in Precarious. These warehouses are especially secure, combining alarm, seal of the magi, and glyph of warding with mundane and magic traps. These warehouses cost twice as much to use as their mundane counterparts, but merchants with a serious interest in security readily pay the price.

##### Sydocks
A system using gigantic arcane cranes and levitation that carries material up from Cliffside and the docks.

### The Stores
A warehouse district with a large halfling population, with ties to the Boromar Clan.

The Stores district has much in common with Precarious. However, the Stores is not actually built on the cliffside, and the Watch focuses its attention and resources on Precarious. The result is that the Stores are slightly more dangerous than Precarious, and smugglers are more likely to hide their goods in these warehouses. The Boromar Clan has strong interests in this district, and thus a considerable halfling population can be found here.

**Desc:** Wide storage towers dominate this district, surrounded by tenements and smaller warehouses. The streets are full of wagons and laborers hauling goods to and from the skydocks of Precarious.
