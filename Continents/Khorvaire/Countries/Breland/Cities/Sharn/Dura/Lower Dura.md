[[Dura]]

## About
The aptly named Precarious district in Lower Dura leans out over the edge of the cliffs, and the Skydocks—a system using gigantic arcane cranes and levitation—carry material up from Cliffside and the docks. Precarious is also filled with warehouses that hold these goods. Because Precarious plays an important role in the economy of the city, it’s the only district in Lower Dura where the Sharn Watch maintains a significant presence.

The rest of Lower Dura, in stark contrast, has been left to rot. Ignored by the Watch, it is the domain of gangs and crime lords. The inhabitants of the ward are often protected from violence by their criminal connections or by virtue of having nothing worth stealing, but adventurers ought to tread lightly here, especially those who display the trappings of a wealthy lifestyle.

There was a time when Lower Dura was the heart of Sharn, and remnants of this glory remain. The Silvermist Theater in Callestan was built to entertain nobles. The ward boasted manors, temples, and a garrison for the watch. But all of these edifices were abandoned long ago, and now most are home to nothing but squatters and vermin.

The district of Callestan is a nexus of sorts, where all the major criminal powers of Sharn have a stake. Those groups are described in more detail later in this chapter.

The district of Fallen is a haunted ruin; this temple district was abandoned after it was struck by a falling tower. It’s covered in more detail later in this chapter.

Malleon’s Gate is home to the goblins of Sharn, along with other monstrous immigrants from Droaam and Darguun. The district can be an especially dangerous place for half­lings or anyone tied to the Boromar Clan.

Oldkeep and Gate of Gold are wretched tenement districts. A significant halfling community lives in the district known as The Stores, which is also a stronghold for the Boromar Clan.


## Districts

### Callestan
Home to an assortment of squalid and poor businesses, Callestan is a nexus for criminal activity and known as a stronghold of the Boromar Clan.

#### The Anvil
This fading Ghallanda inn struggles to maintain its poor to modest quality. It’s known to be under the protection of the Boromar Clan, which makes it one of the safest establishments in Lower Dura.

#### The Broken Mirror
A curious tavern owned by a family of changelings, the Broken Mirror changes its appearance and theme every week. It’s rumored to be connected to the Tyrants.

#### The Silvermist Theater
A remnant of Callestan’s glory days, this place is a shadow of the grand establishment it once was. The current owners are known for staging bizarre events at the Silvermist. Since the Sharn Watch stays out of Callestan, anything can happen here.

### Fallen
Sharn’s oldest temple district, Fallen was abandoned after a floating tower crashed into the district during the Last War. Now it’s a collection of wretched ruins.

### Gate of Gold
A squalid slum, providing miserable housing for desperate people.

### Malleon’s Gate
A poor district originally inhabited by goblins, Malleon’s Gate has become a haven for monstrous immigrants from Droaam and Darguun, along with members of Daask.

### Oldkeep
Another poor slum, largely home to dockworkers from Precarious.

### Pecarious
The skydocks of Precarious pass goods between the towers and the port on the Dagger River below. The district is filled with warehouses, along with a handful of poor taverns. A small community of Sarlonans lives here.

#### Sydocks
A system using gigantic arcane cranes and levitation that carries material up from Cliffside and the docks.

### The Stores
A warehouse district with a large halfling population, with ties to the Boromar Clan.
