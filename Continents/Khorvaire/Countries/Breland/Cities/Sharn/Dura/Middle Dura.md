## About
Middle Dura caters to the working class. Its taverns are modestly priced, but there’s gold among the dross.

The Bazaar of Dura is the largest commercial district in Sharn. In addition to the dozens of permanent shops and smithies, the streets of the bazaar are an ever-changing tapestry of stalls and tents. It’s said that you can find anything here, if you’re not too worried about where it came from and if you’re prepared to contend with the cutpurses that prey on the crowds.

A small selection of merchants that regularly do business at the bazaar is given on the Bazaar Merchants table; roll a d10, or choose a location of interest.

Elsewhere in Middle Dura, the district of Hareth’s Folly is a bizarre blend of architectural styles. One of the primary attractions is the Hollow Tower, an enormous arena that features aerial jousting and racing. The King of Fire is a grand tavern that hosts a broad range of gambling and bookmaking activities, legal and otherwise.

Many people make their homes in Middle Dura, even if their jobs take them elsewhere. Rattlestone and Tumbledown are mostly poor tenements. Stormhold contains crumbling manors still occupied by some of Sharn’s oldest families, while many that have prospered have moved on to more prestigious districts.

## Districts

### The Bazaar
The largest commercial district in Sharn, an excellent place to buy or sell used—and possibly stolen—goods.

**Desc:** The crowd and noise of this district are overwhelming. In addition to the shops and stalls, the streets are full of people offering questionable goods and deals; it seems like everyone has something to sell. The Watch maintains a strong presence in the Bazaar, but they are more concerned with preventing riots than in stopping trade of illegal goods.

##### Caerlyn’s Blade
A troop of Valenar mercenaries that calls itself Caerlyn’s Blades uses the Bazaar as a base of operations.

##### The Shrine of the Keeper
While the Keeper is associated with death, he is fi rst and foremost the god of greed—the hunger to possess all things, from gold to souls. [[Gellis Candar]] runs a large pawnshop in the Bazaar, and he maintains a shrine to the Keeper in a hidden back chamber. A few of the other merchants know of the shrine and attend Candar’s services, believing that the Keeper can help them fulfi ll their greedy desires.

##### Vundry
[[Vundry]] runs a shop in the Bazaar of Dura. On the surface, appears to be a pawnshop and curio store. Behind this façade, Vundry is one of the most reliable and well-connected fences in Sharn. When dealing with a friend ), Vundry can turn up almost any item within a week.

Normally, Vundry buys any legal item for 45% of its value, up to a limit of 10,000 gp. Her shop is full of odds and ends of all sorts—pottery shards from Xen’drik, a masterwork broadsword, a Riedran spice rack. For her friends, Vundry raises her limit to 30,000 gp and pays 55% of the value of items that she buys. Vundry also fences illegal goods, charging 20% of the value of the item. She usually drops this fee by 1% every subsequent time she does business with the same character, to a minimum of 10%. It can be expensive establishing credentials with Vundry, but over time it is worth the expense.

### Broken Arch
Once a proud residential district, Broken Arch has fallen into disrepair. Its housing is poor to modest in quality, though the shells of wealthy manors can still be seen.

Early in the history of Sharn, Barchan’s Arch was one of the fi nest residential districts in the city. Barchan ir’Tyran, a powerful nobleman, along with Hestian ir’Tain, helped shape the City of Towers. Then, during the reign of King Galifar the Dark, the ir’Tyran family attempted to seize the throne of the kingdom. Those ir’Tyrans who survived were stripped of their noble rank and banished from Galifar. Since then, Barchan’s Arch has been shunned by the powerful families of Sharn, and it has fallen into disrepair; two hundred years ago, people began calling it “Broken Arch,” and the name stuck.

**Desc:** Rows of stone houses circle the central towers of this district. The stone is worn and cracks are beginning to show. The streets are surprisingly quiet and empty. The people view strangers with suspicion and fear, and hurry toward their destinations.


### Hareth’s Folly
A jumble of architectural styles, Hareth’s Folly is a place to gamble and enjoy modest food and drink. The Hollow Tower is a center for aerial sports, and Hareth’s Folly is where the Race of Eight Winds begins and ends.

Today, common opinion believes that the architect Hareth ir’Talan was mad. He should never have been allowed to work on a project as important as the construction of a Sharn district, but gold and family connections gave him his chance. The result was the district now known as Hareth’s Folly. At fi rst, Hareth sought to include buildings in the styles of all the contemporary cultures of the kingdom, so that visitors from all parts of Galifar would feel at home. As construction continued, he began to add new designs, based on his visions of the architecture of Syrania, Thelanis, and the other divine realms. As a result, all manner of different buildings can be found in Hareth’s Folly, including some of the strangest structures in Khorvaire. While most believe that Hareth was mad, a minority feel that he was driven by divine inspiration.

**Desc:** The buildings of this district are a bizarre mishmash of architectural styles and materials. Narrow spires stand across from squat brick keeps and densewood halls. In addition to the bridges connecting the great towers of the district, a maze of suspended rope, wood, and stone roads connect the upper levels within the towers, creating the impression of a mad spider web. Music and song can be heard echoing from various towers, and people laugh and run through the streets.

##### The Hollow Tower
Hareth ir’Talan constructed Sharn’s fi rst aerial arena, and over the centuries this odd structure has brought a great deal of silver into the district. While most windchases occur outside the towers, skyblade matches and many other aerial sports are played in an enclosed space. The Hollow Tower provides that space—multiple levels of one of the great towers converted into an enormous domed arena, lined with everbright lanterns to provide illumination at all hours. Today, many of the more prestigious events take place at Cornerstone in Middle Tavick’s Landing, but the Hollow Tower still does a brisk business, and many of the other districts use the tower as a training ground.


##### The King of Fire
A comfortable tavern and gambling hall, known as one of the safest places to bet on the Race of Eight Winds and the events at the Hollow Tower.

The most common deck of playing cards used in Khorvaire has four suits, each tied to one of the four elements. The largest tavern in Hareth’s Folly uses the King of Fire as its trade sign. The tavern, a strange structure supposedly inspired by Hareth’s visions of Fernia, consists of black stone and brass, and continual fl ame spells have been placed on fi xtures throughout the building— including tables and chairs. Half a dozen card games constantly play out in the back rooms of the King, and the place does a brisk business in gambling on races and skyblade matches.

[[Lat Horasca]] , a former Glidewing jockey, owns the tavern, which he won in a dramatic hand of cards. Lat is a gambler, not an innkeeper, but he has married into House Ghallanda and his wife [[Kela Ghallanda]] manages the day-to-day affairs of the business. Things can get rowdy during the Race of Eight Winds, but Lat has wisely invested in an excellent bouncer, an ogre named [[Korrla]]. When she’s not working, Korrla often fi ghts at the Burning Ring in Lower Menthis.

### Rattlestone
Rattlestone is a tenement district. Its people have little but their pride, but there’s a strong camaraderie between them.

The inhabitants of Rattlestone are poor, but most have jobs of one sort or another in the Bazaar. Many of the Watch patrols that protect this district are made up of native Rattlestoners. In comparison to most members of the Dura Watch, the Rattlestone guards are more likely to risk life and limb to protect the people of the district. But this doesn’t apply to strangers, outsiders, or adventurers, and members of the Watch may actually help the local pickpockets and charlatans carry out their scams.

**Desc:** The housing towers in this district are packed with people. The district shows its age. Cobblestones are cracked or missing, and the worn stone walls have been marred by time and vandalism. However, the people seem cheerful enough despite the squalid conditions.

### Stormhold
A comfortable residential district, Stormhold is home to the few powerful families that have remained in Dura. It’s in better condition than most of Middle Dura, and Deneith mercenaries protect the streets.

Clifftop solicitors, overseers from the workhouses in Redstone and the Bazaar, and other successful crafters and merchants have made their homes in Stormhold. A number of manors built by the aristocratic founding families of Sharn in the fi rst days of the city can be found in this district, but most of the powerful families have moved on to Central Plateau or Skyway in recent centuries. A handful of the Sixty great families still live in this district, however. The townhouses of Stormhold are generally cramped and uncomfortable, but the walls are thick and the doors stout.

**Desc:** The houses of this district are extremely solid, and almost seem more like miniature fortresses than residences. The people tend to be serious and suspicious. Children are kept off the streets, and strangers are watched closely.

### Tumbledown
A poor residential district, Tumbledown has experienced recent incursions from Daask. Tumbledown is a wretched residential district, home to the poorest inhabitants of Middle Dura. While it has little to offer, it is at least occasionally patrolled by the Sharn Watch, which provides the inhabitants with a limited sense of security.

Daask has recently established a dreamlily den in one of the tenements of Tumbledown, run by a gnoll named [[Caasht]]. A small band of gnolls provides security for the den. This is a direct challenge to the Boromar Clan’s control of dreamlily distribution, but so far the Boromars have not struck back.

**Desc:** The walls of Tumbledown are honeycombed with tiny chambers, and massive tenements occupy the center of the towers. Large or small, these townhouses are in terrible condition; walls are chipped and cracked, and mold and mildew covers everything. The people crammed into Tumbledown are poor and miserable.

### Underlook
The center of Sharn’s nightlife before Menthis Plateau was built, Underlook is a collection of poor taverns and inns. The district was filled with fine restaurants, inns, and other forms of entertainment. But over the centuries the fi nest establishments have moved to other towers, leaving Underlook to decay in the shadows. Honest sailors and merchants who arrive at Cliffside often choose to stay in Underlook instead of risking life and limb in the Lower Wards.

In addition to the inns and taverns of Underlook, there are a wide number of businesses that are, while not illegal, often held in low regard. In particular, Underlook is an excellent place to hire inquisitives. While the heirs of Tharashk are generally considered to be the best inquisitives in Khorvaire, there are a number of capable non-house operatives in the district who can do the job if the price is right.

**Desc:** The Underlook district has seen better days. Dingy inns and restaurants line the streets, but many old businesses have closed and been transformed into wretched tenements. Nonetheless, cheap lodging is plentiful and travelers from across Khorvaire walk the streets.

##### Ghallanda Hall
This proud Ghallanda enclave continues to operate amid the fading squalor of Middle Dura, and has become a tourist attraction. It offers a range of services, with food and lodging of poor to comfortable quality.

Ghallanda Hall was the fi rst outpost House Ghallanda established in Sharn, and while it is not as fancy as the enclave in Dragon Towers, it still makes for an imposing place. The hall is divided into three sections, each catering to customers with different fi nancial means—effectively, an upscale, average, and poor lodging combined into one. Some rooms have been specially prepared for members of different races, so halfl ings and gnomes can feel at home in a smaller environment. While each section of the inn has its own common room, there is also a grand hall open to all that features a tavern and a stage. Acts change on a nightly basis, and Ghallanda Hall generally has the best entertainment in Middle Dura.

Ghallanda Hall is one of the few locations where the house hosts its heroes’ feasts. A private dining room in the upscale quarter of the hall is reserved for this function, and the clients receive exceptional treatment and entertainment to accompany the enchanted meal.

The current Lord of Ghallanda Hall, [[Keslo d’Ghallanda]], bears the Least Mark of Hospitality (purify food and drink). Keslo is a man of many talents, a diplomat, a poet, and a master chef. Eight elite Ghallanda guards provide security, and two clawfoot dinosaurs can be brought into play during serious altercations.

##### Information Acquisition
When people think of inquisitives, House Tharashk usually springs to mind. [[Kalaash’arrna]], a cunning man with the Lesser Mark of Finding (locate object, locate creature), runs Information Acquisition (Lhash’ta’raak in the orcish tongue) for the house. As the name implies, InAc specializes in information gathering—shadowing people, digging up dirt, and similar, often unsavory tasks.

Kalaash’arrna never betrays his clients; however, he is completely ruthless when it comes to fulfi lling his contracts. Kalaash comes from one of the poorer families of the house. The success of InAc directly refl ects on his family, and he is determined to prove his value to the house. While Kalaash serves as the primary inquisitive at InAc, he employs four lesser inquisitives, all unmarked members of House Tharashk. These include two 2nd-level rogues and two 3rd-level experts.
