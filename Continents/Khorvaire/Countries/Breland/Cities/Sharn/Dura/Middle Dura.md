[[Dura]]

## About

Middle Dura caters to the working class. Its taverns are modestly priced, but there’s gold among the dross.

The Bazaar of Dura is the largest commercial district in Sharn. In addition to the dozens of permanent shops and smithies, the streets of the bazaar are an ever-changing tapestry of stalls and tents. It’s said that you can find anything here, if you’re not too worried about where it came from and if you’re prepared to contend with the cutpurses that prey on the crowds.

A small selection of merchants that regularly do business at the bazaar is given on the Bazaar Merchants table; roll a d10, or choose a location of interest.

Elsewhere in Middle Dura, the district of Hareth’s Folly is a bizarre blend of architectural styles. One of the primary attractions is the Hollow Tower, an enormous arena that features aerial jousting and racing. The King of Fire is a grand tavern that hosts a broad range of gambling and bookmaking activities, legal and otherwise.

Many people make their homes in Middle Dura, even if their jobs take them elsewhere. Rattlestone and Tumbledown are mostly poor tenements. Stormhold contains crumbling manors still occupied by some of Sharn’s oldest families, while many that have prospered have moved on to more prestigious districts.

## Districts

### The Bazaar
The largest commercial district in Sharn, an excellent place to buy or sell used—and possibly stolen—goods.

### Broken Arch
Once a proud residential district, Broken Arch has fallen into disrepair. Its housing is poor to modest in quality, though the shells of wealthy manors can still be seen.

### Hareth’s Folly
A jumble of architectural styles, Hareth’s Folly is a place to gamble and enjoy modest food and drink. The Hollow Tower is a center for aerial sports, and Hareth’s Folly is where the Race of Eight Winds begins and ends.

#### The Hollow Tower
A vertically oriented arena used for aerial jousting and other unusual sporting events.


#### The King of Fire
A comfortable tavern and gambling hall, known as one of the safest places to bet on the Race of Eight Winds and the events at the Hollow Tower.

### Rattlestone
Rattlestone is a tenement district. Its people have little but their pride, but there’s a strong camaraderie between them.

### Stormhold
A comfortable residential district, Stormhold is home to the few powerful families that have remained in Dura. It’s in better condition than most of Middle Dura, and Deneith mercenaries protect the streets.


### Tumbledown
A poor residential district, Tumbledown has experienced recent incursions from Daask.

### Underlook
The center of Sharn’s nightlife before Menthis Plateau was built, Underlook is a collection of poor taverns and inns.


#### Ghallanda Hall
This proud Ghallanda enclave continues to operate amid the fading squalor of Middle Dura, and has become a tourist attraction. It offers a range of services, with food and lodging of poor to comfortable quality.
