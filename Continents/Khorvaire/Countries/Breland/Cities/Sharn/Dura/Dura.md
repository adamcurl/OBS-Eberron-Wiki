[[Sharn]]

Sharn began where Dura stands, but the city has left it behind in many ways. Many nowadays consider the oldest quarter of Sharn to be a blight on the City of Towers. The place is full of cracked and crumbling stonework, abandoned lift shafts, and everbright lanterns that have burned out and never been restored. Dura is riddled with poverty and crime; it’s easily the most dangerous section of the city. But it also holds opportunities you can’t find anywhere else. If you’re looking for smuggled goods or a place to lie low, head to Dura.

## Things To Do

Dura is a quarter of extremes, from the nearly idyllic atmosphere of Upper Dura, down to the danger of Lower Dura. Among its attractions and diversions are these:

* **Gamble.** Legal gambling is heavily taxed in the city and limited in its scope. Dura is the place to find a wide range of shadier and more profitable games.
* **Go shopping.** The Bazaar of Middle Dura is an excellent source for exotic goods, legal or otherwise. Clifftop, in Upper Dura, caters to adventurers and has a reasonable selection of magical goods.
* **Bend the law.** Looking for a fence or need to hire an assassin? Lower Dura is the nexus for criminal activities in Sharn.
* **Talk about the race.** The inhabitants of Dura are devoted to the Race of Eight Winds and are always willing to discuss the latest news.
* **Suffer a terrible accident. **The Sharn Watch ignores much of Lower Dura. Stories circulate continuously about dragonmarked houses and mad wizards conducting dangerous experiments in Lower Dura without interference from the law.
