[[Dura]]

- **Population:** 17,400
- **Social Class:** Middle Class

- **Districts:** Garrison, temple district, shops (2), apartment homes (2), dwarf neighborhood, average residences, adventurer’s quarter
- **Business:** Upscale if a bit on the worn side, with more shops catering to adventurers than in most other districts; gold piece limit: 40,000 gp

## About
This ward is full of activity. Its people are prospering, but there’s an edge of desperation about them; many folk are on the lookout for opportunities to better themselves. Upper Dura has the general properties of a middle ward, with most goods and services priced for a modest or comfortable lifestyle. The merchants and artisans are accustomed to dealing with unusual individuals, and adventurers receive a warm welcome here.

Clifftop is a home away from home for explorers and mercenaries. Daggerwatch is a fortress district, containing garrisons for the Sharn Watch and the Brelish army. The Gold & White is a Daggerwatch tavern that caters to Brelish soldiers; those who hold a Brelish military rank will receive a warm welcome, while those who served other nations would be wise to take their business elsewhere.

In the dwarven district of Highhold, a center of activity is Morragin’s, which serves the strongest spirits in Sharn, but it’s no mere tavern; often patronized by Mror merchants and Kundarak agents, it maintains the highest of standards (with prices to match).

The Highwater district is home to the wealthiest inhabitants of Dura and is the site of Pegasus Spire, the enclave of House Vadalis. The temple district of Hope’s Peak features the Citadel of Light, a grand temple of Dol Arrah and a bastion for the virtuous. The Overlook district is home to Sharn’s kalashtar community and includes the only temple of the Path of Light in Breland.

## Districts

### Clifftop
This district caters to adventurers, with a wide array of businesses aimed at explorers and fortune hunters. It is the home base of the Clifftop Adventurer’s Guild.

Clifftop is a curious blend of wealth and poverty. Most of the businesses in the district are serviceable, but not exceptional, providing for the needs of the adventurer who rarely has more than a few pieces of gold in his purse. It also provides services for the lucky explorer or privateer who has returned home with gold to spare, with commercial spellcasters, shops selling used wands and old mageworked weapons, and other exotic goods readily available. While similar in many ways to the Deathsgate district, Clifftop has a better and generally well-deserved reputation.

The district provides a number of services adventurers may fi nd useful. A wide variety of hirelings can be found here, and all of them are used to putting up with the odd demands of adventurers. Likewise, as adventurers have a way of getting into trouble with the law, there are a considerable number of barristers and advocates in the district. The pawnshops of Clifftop offer 45% of value for almost any sorts of goods, except those that are obviously stolen; fences that deal in stolen goods must be found in the lower levels of Dura.

**Desc:** The towers of this district are drab gray granite, but the crowds that fi ll the streets are quite colorful. People of all races and cultures can be seen. An Aundairian wizard compares notes with a kalashtar monk in the shade of a tavern, while across the street a Lhazaar privateer and a Valenar elf compare blades. Clifftop is a fairly dingy district—but it attracts an interesting crowd.

##### The Augury
This shop, located in the section of Clifftop known as the mystic market, features a circle of magewrights who possess the ability to cast divinatory spells, including augury, clairaudience/clairvoyance, detect magic, detect scrying, divination, identify, locate creature, locate object, and scrying.

The master magewright of The Augury is a 334- year-old elf named [[Kestia]]. As it sells sending, locate, and alarm spells, The Augury cuts into the profi ts of a number of the dragonmarked houses, notably Tharashk, Sivis, and Kundarak. Some believe that Kestia uses blackmail to protect herself from the retribution of the houses, while others say that she appeases the houses with a share of her profi ts. She has refused to join the Esoteric Order of Aureon or the Guild of Starlight and Shadows, preferring to remain independent.

##### [[Clifftop Adventurers' Guild]]
An institution that provides adventurers with camaraderie and profitable work.

One hundred and fifty years ago, a dwarf named Shekkal Korranor established a guild for explorers and wanderers—a place where those with adventurous spirits could fi nd good company and support. Shekkal died in the Last War, but the Clifftop Adventurers’ Guild remains. Members tend to be 2nd- to 5th-level characters with good alignments, most of whom have spent some time in Xen’drik. There is a strong rivalry between the members of the Clifftop Adventurers’ Guild and Deathsgate Explorer’s Club, and characters that join Clifftop may have to deal with Deathsgate hooligans—either in Sharn or while adventuring in the wilds.

##### The Dragon’s Hoard
The Dragon’s Hoard sells a wide assortment of wondrous items. Members of the Clifftop Adventurers’ Guild receive a 5% discount off the normal market price for items purchased here.

##### The Drunken Dragon
A tavern frequented by members of the Clifftop Adventurer’s Guild. The food is modest, but it has the widest selection of exotic alcohol in Sharn.

A bizarre assortment of odds and ends cover the walls of the Drunken Dragon tavern, including the trophies of a hundred expeditions to Xen’drik, the Demon Wastes, and other strange lands. Among the oldest pubs in Upper Dura, the Drunken Dragon is a long-time favorite of explorers, adventurers, and privateers. Slow service and poor food aside, the Drunken Dragon has one of the widest selections of exotic alcoholic beverages in Sharn. From Mror ale and Lhazaar mead to the orcish hrak of the Shadow Marches and fermented honey-milk brewed by the shifters of the Eldeen Reaches, if it’s strong and strange it can be found at the Drunken Dragon.

The Dragon has become one of the main places to hire adventurers; if a party has no specifi c agenda and simply hopes to fi nd work, it could do worse than to have a few drinks at the Drunken Dragon. The Dragon is a tavern as opposed to an inn, but it does have two private rooms that parties can use when discussing secret business or important deals.

The Drunken Dragon is owned by [[Hascal d’Ghallanda]], a cheerful middle-aged halfling. Hascal began his life as an explorer, but gave up the trade after losing his lower left leg and his right eye in a particularly disastrous trip to Xen’drik, and returned to pick up the family business. He has an assortment of beautifully carved artifi cial limbs and colorful eye patches that correspond to his fl amboyant outfi ts. Hascal is an extremely knowledgeable and talented fellow who, given an opportunity, can spend hours talking about his adventures.

Hascal possesses the Least Mark of Hospitality and has the power to cast refuge; while he generally saves this for personal protection, for enough gold he could be convinced to cast it on behalf of a group of favored customers. Though he no longer actively adventures, Hascal remains a member of the Clifftop Adventurers’ Guild. Members of the guild get a +1 circumstance bonus on all Knowledge (local) and Gather Information checks made in the Drunken Dragon.


##### [[The Esoteric Order of Aureon]]
The guildhall of one of Sharn’s most prestigious arcane orders. A reliable source for arcane spellcasting services.

The larger of Sharn’s wizard circles, the Esoteric Order of Aureon has its headquarters in Clifftop. The Order’s tower is built of white marble, and glamers have been woven into the stone that cause the tower to shimmer and glow so that it seems as if it has been crafted of solid light.

Not all members of the Order sell their services, but if a party seeks an arcane spellcaster in Clifftop, this is the place to visit. Generally, spells of up to 3rd level can be obtained at standard prices, and 4th-level spells may be available. However, the wizards of the Order may not have the spell a party seeks prepared; in such cases, a client must wait 24 hours to complete their purchase.


##### House Sivis
In addition to the local message station, House Sivis maintains an enclave in Clifftop devoted to the Speaker’s Guild. This enclave specializes in two things: the translation of texts and other materials recovered from Xen’drik, and legal services for adventurers in trouble. [[Josilian Kan d’Tarlian]] works out of this office, and is widely considered to be one of the best barristers in Sharn—though at a base price of 25 gp/day (and possibly more, depending on the nature of the case), he is certainly one of the most expensive.


##### House Tharashk
The House of Finding has a great interest in Xen’drik and the mineral wealth that can be found there, as well as an interest in the other dark lands of Eberron—Q’barra, the Demon Wastes, Khyber, and the Mournland. The Tharashk enclave in Clifftop is primarily concerned with exploration and prospecting. The house sells the services of guides, and many of its members have fi rsthand experience in Xen’drik and Khyber. In addition to the powers of their dragonmarks, these guides can provide invaluable information about the threats lurking in these regions. When the house plans expeditions to Xen’drik, these are usually arranged at the Clifftop enclave. Due to the rivalry with Tharashk and Deneith, the house often recruits adventurers to protect an expedition instead of hiring Deneith mercenaries.


##### Kavv’s
This little restaurant is one of the wellkept secrets of Sharn, and without a recommendation a character only knows about it if he can make a DC 16 Investigation/History/Persuassion check. The Kavv family emigrated from the city of Stormreach in Xen’drik, and the food is an intriguing blend of Khorvairian styles, using Xen’drik spices and vegetables most people have never encountered. Kavv’s is a small, intimate establishment, and despite the extremely high quality of the food, a typical meal averages 30 cp. [[Saza Kavv|Saza]] and [[Taji Kavv]] still have many friends and relatives in Stormreach, and if the party befriends the Kavvs these contacts could prove to be useful during trips to Xen’drik.


##### Kurala’s House of Healing
Explorers tend to need healing more than merchants and crafters, and [[Kurala d’Jorasco]] does a brisk business in Clifftop. In addition to possessing the Least Mark of Healing (lesser restoration), she is an adept of Boldrei and can perform magical healing for her clients, including remove curse and remove disease. While she runs her own business, Kurala is a respected member of House Jorasco and is often called in to help the healers in Dragon Towers. Kurala’s House includes three lesser healers—two 3rd-level adepts and a 4th-level expert with the Least Mark of Healing (cure light wounds)—and Kurala’s husband [[Janasar]], who specializes in the care and treatment of animals.

##### The Mystic Market
A collection of shops specializing in different categories of magic items. Most merchandise is common or uncommon, but rare items are occasionally available. 

The white tower of the Esoteric Order of Aureon is surrounded by a host of lesser magic businesses. Most true wizards work with the Esoteric Order or the Guild of Starlight and Shadow, and the Mystic Market consists mainly of magewrights and adepts. Businesses in the market include:
- **The Mithral Blade**, a smithy that produces steel and mithral weapons and armor with up to a +2 enhancement bonus
- **Wise Wood**, a shop that buys and sells wands and staves
- **The Moonlit Loom**, which sells magic clothing
- **The Dragon’s Hoard**, which sells a wide assortment of minor wondrous items and does a brisk business in feather fall talismans
- **Boldrei’s Tears**, sells potions
- **Good Spirits**, sells potions and poisons


### Daggerwatch
Daggerwatch holds garrisons for both the Sharn Watch and the Brelish army, along with business and residences for those who support the garrisons.

Dura is easily the most dangerous quarter of the city, and during the Last War riots and other forms of unrest were a constant concern. Plus, the Race of the Eight Winds usually results in various forms of crime and vandalism. As a result, Daggerwatch has the largest concentration of the City Watch in Sharn. Many low-ranking city offi cials, including judges and tax collectors, make their homes in Dagger watch and rely on the presence of the Watch to protect them from vengeful citizens.

**Desc:** This may be the cleanest and quietest district in Dura. The walls of the towers are heavily reinforced, as if to withstand siege weaponry. The streets are fi lled with guards of the Watch, both patrols and off-duty guards; it looks like a bad place to start a fight.

#### Places of Interest
- **Dol Doron temple**
- **Training grounds**

##### Daggerwatch Garrison
The eponymous garrison in the district is the home to over 600 members of the Sharn Watch. In addition to the regular offi - cers of the Watch, Daggerwatch Garrison houses the Goldwings and includes facilities for maintaining the unit’s 25 hippogriffs.


##### The Gold & White
This tavern offers fare of comfortable quality at modest prices. It caters to members of the Sharn Watch and Brelish veterans, but others will receive a cold welcome.


##### Talain Garrison
This fortress houses both the Sharn Watch and the elite Redcloak Battalion. While slightly smaller than the Daggerwatch Garrison, it is far more heavily fortifi ed and could withstand an extended siege.


### Highhold
A district built by dwarves for dwarves, Highhold has strong Mror influences in its architecture. It’s a good place to find Mror goods and is home to talented smiths and brewers.

**Desc:** The architecture is sturdy, functional stone, though the scale is slightly too small for most humans. While there is luxury to be found here, the citizens of Holdfast put work before play.

#### Places of Interest

##### Clebdecher’s Loom
While most people think of dwarves as grim and stoic individuals, the merchant princes of the Mror Holds take great pride in their appearance and clothing. Run by [[Hellien Clamas Clebdecher]], Clebdecher’s Loom specializes in fine clothing in Mrorian and Zil styles. Clebdecher is one of the finest workers of glamerweave in the city, and many human lords and ladies come to Holdfast to avail themselves of her talents. As a result, there is usually a considerable wait for Hellian’s services; anyone preparing for an important event needs to plan ahead to purchase a Clebdecher gown or suit.

##### Moraggan’s
A posh tavern specializing in strong Mror spirits. Food and drink are wealthy in quality and cost.

The Mror spirits served at Moraggan’s might be the strongest drink in Sharn. However, Moraggan’s is a far cry from the rough and tumble saloon one might expect from a place with such a reputation. This posh, luxurious establishment has considerable security and a number of private, soundproofed rooms. Moraggan’s caters to Kundarak agents and other Mror merchants—traders and crafters who believe that strong drink and business negotiation go hand in hand.


### Highwater
The finest residential district in Dura and the seat of House Vadalis, Highwater is largely comfortable in quality with a few wealthy estates.

**Desc:** Quiet streets wind around townhouse towers in a relatively safe environment.

#### Places of Interest

##### Pegasus Spire
The seat of House Vadalis in Sharn is one of the few enclaves where pegasi are raised and trained. Native to Syrania, these celestial beasts can become stranded in Sharn; Vadalis heirs care for them and match them with virtuous companions.

The Sharn Vadalis have always enjoyed participating in the Race of Eight Winds and the Highwater Wind Guard has always included members of the family. In addition to serving as the manor for the Vadalis family, Pegasus Spire provides the stable and training facilities for the pegasi used in the race.

### Hope’s Peak
A relatively new temple district, with shrines and churches that have relocated from Fallen in Lower Dura. Hope’s Peak includes several monasteries and a sacred grove.

**Desc:** Many of the towers in this district are built from blocks of white stone flecked with spots of gold, and when the sunlight falls on Hope’s Peak it seems to glow and burn.

#### Places of Interest
- **Sovereign Host temple**
- **Silver flame temple**
- **Dol Arrah temple**
- **Aureon shrine**
- **Boldrei shrine**
- **Olladra shrine**

##### The Citadel of the Sun
A temple devoted to Dol Arrah, noteworthy for the three blessed griffons that reside there. The tallest tower in Hope’s Peak is the Citadel of the Sun, a temple dedicated to Dol Arrah, the Sovereign lady of Sun and Sword. The stone of the tower has been enchanted to shine like gold, but it is still stone—something that has proven to be a grave disappointment to many a beggar who has sought to scrape a shaving from the wall. [[Aerela Tal]], a devoted priest who served with distinction in the war before retiring, maintains the temple. Aerela does not sell divine spells, but she may provide assistance in exchange for services; she is distressed by the darkness in Sharn, and would like to see light shed on the shadows of the city.

This large and beautiful temple’s tower rises far above the other districts of Upper Dura. At the top lies a garden, where three golden griffons—halfcelestial creatures said to have been touched by the lady of the sun—reside. The griffons rarely stray from the tower, but an oracle has said that they will rise and fi ght at the time of Sharn’s greatest peril. Killing one of these creatures would be a heinous crime that would outrage the devotees of the goddess.

##### Olladra’s Arms
This restaurant, one of the brightest spots in Dura, is considered to be one of the fi nest restaurants in the city. In addition to a few private rooms, it features a vast central hall suitable for enormous parties or feasts. The menu consists of traditional Brelish cuisine, but choices are limited. The master chef, [[Halean Doss]], chooses a single menu each night. However, quantities are generous and the quality of the food is outstanding.


### Overlook
Built with the fortune of the ir’Tain family, Overlook is one of the largest residential districts in Sharn. The remarkably bland stonework creates a vast, gray vista that can be disconcerting. The ir’Tains were interested in getting the most for their gold, however, and aesthetics were not a concern. While the townhouse apartments in Overlook are not as pleasant as those in Lower Northedge, they are inexpensive and far safer than the wards that lie below. Plus, the area offers breathtaking views of the Dagger River and the surrounding countryside.

Overlook is noteworthy for its kalashtar community, which maintains a community center, a shrine devoted to the Path of Light, and a few restaurants serving Sarlonan cuisine.

**Desc:** The spires of over a dozen identical towers rise to the sky. While the towers are drab gray granite, bits of color are scattered about—an occasional window of stained glass, a small hanging garden, a tapestry of Riedran design.

#### Places of Interest
- **Path of Light shrine**
- **Exotic trades**

##### The Gathering Light
The Adarans and kalashtar are concentrated on the northern edge of Overlook. Adaran citizens have pooled their resources to rent a large hall, the Gathering Light, that serves as an anchor for the community. During the day, the hall functions as a school, where people come to study kalashtar martial arts and meditation techniques. In the evenings, the people gather to celebrate their heritage. Activities at the gatherings vary considerably. Some nights song, dance, or other forms of art play a dominate role, while other nights involve serious discussions of philosophy, metaphysics, or current events.

[[Selkatari]] oversees martial training and monastic discipline at the Gathering Light, while [[Hanamelk]] serves as the resident scholar and sage. These two also work together to protect the community from crime and violence, using diplomacy when possible and force when reason fails.

##### Hilatashka
Hidden away in the shadows of one of the gray towers, the Hilatashka restaurant serves Adaran cuisine. Meals are reasonably priced, around 6 cp per person, but the quality is exceptional. Providing vegetarian fare that mostly consists of cold dishes and soups prepared with a range of subtle spices. Kalashtar have an exceptionally well-developed sense of taste, and it can take some time for members of other races to learn to appreciate the delicate blends of spices and herbs used in Adaran meals.

##### The Shrine of il-Yannah
The kalashtarconstructed shrine of il-Yannah, the Path of Light, occupies a small parapet at the top of a tall tower. From the breathtaking views to the Sarlonan incense that scents the air, the shrine radiates a calm, otherworldly peace. Tapestries with intricate, labyrinthine patterns cover the walls and fl oor, adding to the exotic nature of the place. The enlightened [[Havakhad]], a powerful psion whose frail body is beginning to fail, tends the shrine and rarely wanders far from this location. Havakhad gladly offers advice and spiritual guidance to any follower of the Light who comes to meditate at the shrine, and he sometimes uses precognition on behalf of those he considers to be champions.
