[[Dura]]

## About
This ward is full of activity. Its people are prospering, but there’s an edge of desperation about them; many folk are on the lookout for opportunities to better themselves. Upper Dura has the general properties of a middle ward, with most goods and services priced for a modest or comfortable lifestyle. The merchants and artisans are accustomed to dealing with unusual individuals, and adventurers receive a warm welcome here.

Clifftop is a home away from home for explorers and mercenaries. Daggerwatch is a fortress district, containing garrisons for the Sharn Watch and the Brelish army. The Gold & White is a Daggerwatch tavern that caters to Brelish soldiers; those who hold a Brelish military rank will receive a warm welcome, while those who served other nations would be wise to take their business elsewhere.

In the dwarven district of Highhold, a center of activity is Morragin’s, which serves the strongest spirits in Sharn, but it’s no mere tavern; often patronized by Mror merchants and Kundarak agents, it maintains the highest of standards (with prices to match).

The Highwater district is home to the wealthiest inhabitants of Dura and is the site of Pegasus Spire, the enclave of House Vadalis. The temple district of Hope’s Peak features the Citadel of Light, a grand temple of Dol Arrah and a bastion for the virtuous. The Overlook district is home to Sharn’s kalashtar community and includes the only temple of the Path of Light in Breland.
