[[Sharn]]

## About
The Cogs lie deep beneath Sharn, below the sewers and Old Sharn (described later in this chapter). Streams of Fernian lava flow through this area, and over the centuries, House Cannith has helped Breland establish vast foundries that tap this mystic resource. Ashblack and Blackbones are industrial districts, largely inhabited by warforged laborers and miserable workers of other races. It is said that House Cannith maintains a forgehold in the Ashblack district, and that this is where Baron Merrix d’Cannith conducts his experiments.

The Sharn Watch maintains a presence in the Cogs, and overseers from House Cannith are stationed here to keep things in order. Beyond these industrial districts lies the deeper tunnels of Khyber’s Gate, a tenement district.

Blackbones has a number of remarkable locations. For example, the Pool of Onatar’s Tears is sacred to the Sovereign of the Forge. The current caretaker is a warforged priest named Smith, who believes that Onatar has plans for the warforged, and that the warforged and creatures of flesh are meant to live together.

Most of the citizens of Sharn have never been to the Cogs. The area does house the bulk of the city’s warforged population, and if you’re looking for a particular warforged, it’s the best place to start. Industrial espionage and labor struggles can add drama to adventures in the great foundries, not to mention the possibility of artificers with secret forges hidden in the Cogs.


## Districts

### Ashblack
The first foundries of Sharn were built here. The district is devoted to industry, and the environment here is sweltering and claustrophobic.


#### Keldoran Forge
Though most of the foundries in the Cogs are devoted to large-scale industry, the dwarf Antos Keldoran maintains a small forge and produces bespoke arms and armor.


### Blackbones
Blackbones is newer than Ashblack, and it shows. The district’s corridors are wider and better lit. The foundries are well maintained, and the district has a few thriving businesses. Most of the warforged that reside in Sharn work in Blackbones.


#### The Pool of Onatar’s Tears
A small temple in the Blackbones district holds a pool said to be blessed by the god Onatar. Smiths come from across Khorvaire to dip their tools in the pool.


#### The Red Hammer
The Red Hammer is Sharn’s only inn maintained by and for warforged. It offers those who work in the Cogs opportunities to socialize, along with repair and cosmetic services.


## NPCs

### Councilor Nolan Toranak (M dwarf CN) 
* Councilor for the Cogs, is largely seen as a tool of the industrialists who own the foundries there. Members of his family were killed by warforged during the Last War, and Toranak harbors a bitter grudge against House Cannith and the warforged. He has tried to have warforged reclassified as property, and seeks to suppress warforged activists in the Cogs.
