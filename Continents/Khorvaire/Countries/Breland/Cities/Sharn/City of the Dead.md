## About
Look to the cliffs to the north of Sharn, and you’ll see a collection of crypts embedded into the cliff face. This is the City of the Dead, the final resting place of the wealthiest citizens of Sharn. Common folk are cremated after death, but members of the Sixty Families and others with sufficient wealth have their remains interred in the tombs and tunnels of this necropolis.

Few people reside in this area. Among its major features are Aureon’s Holt, a temple of the Restful Watch, where Sovereign priests conduct funerals and serve as the caretakers of the tombs. Warden Tower is an outpost of the Church of the Silver Flame, staffed by a single hermit tasked to watch for supernatural threats.

Though the City of the Dead is largely peaceful, stories circulate about dark powers lurking there. Some parents warn their children of the Lich-Priest Gath, who steals disobedient children and forces them to work in his kingdom of the dead, polishing the bones of his skeletal subjects.

The City of the Dead lies outside of the manifest zone linked to Syrania. Magic items, spells, and feats that take advantage of the manifest zone do not function in the City of the Dead.

##### Warden Tower
Not to be confused with the Warden Towers district in Middle Menthis, Warden Tower is a white obelisk standing on the edge of the cliff overlooking the Clifftop district of Upper Dura. For centuries, Warden Tower has been the home of a line of hermit clerics of the Silver Flame, each of whom has taken the title of Warden. These Wardens are charged (by the church) to watch over the City of the Dead in order to prevent necromancers or undead from troubling the people of Sharn. The current Warden, [[Gaia Sotharr]], is young and idealistic, and she is locked in a power struggle with the lich of Halden’s Tomb. Neither seems to be able to get the upper hand in this struggle, and Gaia is too proud to call for help from her church. In fact, she has an unholy fascination with Gath—as long as he exists, her life has meaning and purpose, and after years of confl ict she would not happily see him destroyed, though she gladly kills his minions and allies. It seems clear that Gath has similar feelings, if he can be said to feel, or else Gaia would certainly not be alive.

### Halden’s Tomb
Halden’s Tomb is the tomb district overlooking Tavick’s Landing on the eastern edge of the city.

**Desc:** Silent tombs stand nestled among the rocky crags of the cliff top, keeping silent watch over the dead.

##### Halden’s Tomb
This district is named for the incredibly ancient mausoleum of Gareth Halden, a great hero of the War of the Mark. His tomb naturally predates most of the buildings of modern Sharn, and has been thoroughly cleaned out by tomb robbers, but it still stands in silent monument to the ancient glory of the first period of human inhabitation of the city.

##### The Mausoleum of Gath
This is not a mausoleum at all, but rather a temple dedicated to the Keeper. Its cleric is a lich called Gath, who built it centuries ago. Gath does not reside here or stay here for long, but visits often enough that any who want to talk (rather than intend to fight) seem to manage to fi nd him here. Most of the time, he haunts various hideouts around the necropolis, mentoring other would-be necromancers and clerics of the Keeper and practicing his dark rites in other mausoleum-temples.
