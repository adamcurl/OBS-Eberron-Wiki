## About
This part of the city is a center for intrigue. The district of Ambassador Towers contains embassies and consulates from the Thronehold Nations, as well as Aerenal and Sarlona. Ambassador Towers is also home to the [[King's Citadel]], the headquarters of Brelish intelligence. Across the ward, the district of Dragon Towers holds the primary enclaves of the dragonmarked houses.

The Sovereign Towers district has the grandest temples in Sharn. The Pavilion of the Host is a complex of nine towers devoted to the Sovereign Host, and the Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame is the seat of the religion. Although these temples are the locations of grand ceremonies and celebrations, many of the most devout priests serve in the city’s smaller shrines.

## Districts

### Ambassador Towers
This district contains the embassies to the Thronehold nations, along with Aerenal and Riedra. It’s also the seat of the Citadel and home to the Brelish Museum of Fine Art.

Ambassador Towers, Sharn’s embassy district, is home to embassies and consulates from eleven foreign nations: Aundair, Cyre, Karrnath, the Lhazaar Principalities, the Mror Holds, the Talenta Plains, Thrane, Valenar, Zilargo, Aerenal, and Riedra. Cyre’s embassy was established here long before the Last War, and its staff continues to advocate for the interests of the villagers of New Cyre, in eastern Breland.

**Desc:** The fl ags of most of Khorvaire’s nations fly in this district, hanging in front of monumental embassy blocks in this district. The crowds include people of all races and many different ethnic backgrounds.

##### Brelish Museum of Fine Art
The museum displays work produced by Brelish artists and relics recovered from Xen’drik.

Breland’s national museum is located in Farhaven Tower, near the Bazaar Bridge leading to Middle Dura. It has two main areas of emphasis: art representing the Brelish spirit (which primarily means any artwork created by a Brelish artist) and antiquities from Xen’drik, which certain people in the Brelish government would like to view as a colony of Breland. Its Brelish art collection is unequalled, and includes some world-famous works by great masters of antebellum Galifar. Its collection of antiquities is also impressive, though it is small in comparison to that of the Dezina Museum at Morgrave University.

##### The Citadel
The headquarters of the King’s Citadel, Breland’s elite military and intelligence service. The Citadel is also a high-security prison holding Sharn’s most dangerous criminals.

An imposing, fortified structure near the middle levels of Andith Tower, the Citadel is both the headquarters of the local Knights of the Citadel and the city jail. A great balcony on the outside of the fortress is guarded by knights but allows easy access to this seat of Brelish law in Sharn. Unexpected visitors to the Citadel rarely receive a warm welcome.

##### Athania’s Companions
One of several “escort services” providing companionship to visiting diplomats in Ambassador Towers as well as well-to-do clients in all of Sharn’s best neighborhoods, Athania’s Companions is unique in at least one respect: it is also a spy ring in the business of collecting, cataloging, and selling secrets. [[Athania]] runs both businesses.

### Dragon Towers
This is the primary place to do business with representatives of the dragonmarked houses. All the houses have outposts here, and Sivis, Tharashk, Jorasco, and Cannith have their primary enclaves in Dragon Towers.

Enclaves belonging to the thirteen dragonmarked houses can be found in this district. Of the thirteen, the most important in Sharn are House Tharashk, House Cannith, House Kundarak, House Sivis, and House Lyrandar. Those five families have the largest enclaves in Dragon Towers, as well as smaller outposts in the areas of the city where they do most of their business.

**Desc:** Wealthy and important-looking people parade through this district with escorts of sycophants and well-armed guards. The sigils of the dragonmarked houses are in abundant view.

##### Tharashk Enclave
The sprawling complex of Tharashk Enclave occupies several levels of three towers near the Sword Point district. A signifi cant percentage of Sharn’s half-orc population lives in this complex. [[Yevgen Torrn]] leads the enclave, and operates as a very expensive inquisitive-for-hire.

##### Globe Information Agency
This inquisitive agency run by [[Kava Velderan]], a dragonmarked heir of the House of Finding, has ties to House Tharashk. Kava prides herself on her ability to find anyone, anywhere. Her agents escalate cases to her attention only when they prove to be nearly impossible to solve.

##### Cannith Enclave
Cannith Enclave inhabits the whole of Cannith Tower. In both Highest Towers (Upper Central) and Granite Halls (Lower Central), members of House Cannith’s Fabricators’ Guild operate artisans’ shops (upscale trades) in the tower. [[Merrix d’Cannith]] leads House Cannith’s Sharn enclave.

##### Lyrandar Enclave
The Lyrandar Enclave in Dragon Towers is relatively small, but only because so much of the house’s operations are housed elsewhere in Sharn. They have several offi ces in the waterfront districts of Cliffside and Lower Dura to manage the house’s shipping interests, and a large offi ce near the airship docking tower at the top of Lyrandar Tower, in the Highest Towers district, manages the house’s air transport business. Though House Orien controls the land shipping in and out of the city, House Lyrandar has offi ces in Lower Tavick’s Landing to facilitate trade between the two houses. [[Solia d’Lyrandar]] oversees the enclave and supervises the operations of all the smaller offi ces, as well.

##### Kundarak Enclave
Kundarak Enclave can be found in Sivis Tower, as the house commands a major presence in the Korranath district (in Upper Central), where the Kundarak Bank is located. Even so, Kundarak Enclave is large and impressive, with marble columns supporting lofty ceilings with dazzling mosaics of precious metals and stones. Security, as one might expect from the House of Warding, is extremely tight. [[Daphanë d’Kundarak]] oversees the enclave, but spends most of her time at the Kundarak Bank.

##### Sivis Enclave
The Sivis Enclave, tightly enclosed in Sivis Tower, shares space with the dwarves of House Kundarak. It has equally grand architecture and ornamentation, though motifs of writing and calligraphic engraving run through the decoration of the Sivis locations. [[Solirion Torralyn d’Sivis]] is the head of the enclave in Sharn, and supervises the Speakers’ Guild operations in Sharn.

##### House Tarkanan
House Tarkanan is a criminal organization structured in mockery of the dragonmarked houses. Its leader, [[Thora Tavin]], is not related to the dragonmarked houses, though she does have an aberrant mark—a fact that she keeps secret from even her closest associates. Thora’s residence, a spacious mansion nestled among the towers of the house enclaves, serves as the secret headquarters of her organization. From here, she personally directs a range of criminal and questionable activities throughout the city, with a particular focus on burglary, assassination, forgery, and loan sharking.

##### The Panaceum
The largest House Jorasco enclave in Sharn provides high-priced healing services to all who can pay for them.


### Sovereign Towers
A district filled with a vast assortment of temples and shrines. It is home to the two most important temples in Sharn: the Pavilion of the Host and the Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame. Unfortunately, too often these monuments seem cold as the faith that inspired them evaporated long ago, replaced by ritual or even a deep corruption.

**Desc:** This district regales all things holy, or at least their representation in art and architecture. Statues, paintings, and mosaics of deities and saints are everywhere, and great temples stand out among the lesser buildings.

##### Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame
The central temple of the Church of the Silver Flame serves both as a templar garrison and the site of grand rituals and celebrations.

Sharn’s most important temple to the Silver Flame, named in honor of the church’s role in cleansing Khorvaire of the stain of evil, ironically may also be its most corrupt holy institution. The Archierophant of the region, Ythana Morr, helps foster this corruption, while many of the clergy and other staff simply covet privilege, power, and material wealth. The Archierophant, however, actively cooperates with the rakshasa Zathara, who lives in the Central Cogs district of Khyber’s Gate.


##### Pavilion of the Host
The center for worship of the Sovereign Host is a grand open tower surrounded by nine temples, each dedicated to one of the Sovereigns.

In the central pavilion, sacrifi ces offered in major festivals and on important holy days honor the pantheon as a whole. The ranking priest in Sharn, High Priest [[Phthaso Mogan]], leads most of these rituals and sacrifi ces. Homes for the many clergy working here occupy several tower levels below the Pavilion.


### Sword Point
This garrison district houses the forces that police and defend Central Plateau and Northedge, including the Sharn Watch and a detachment of the royal army. Just over 500 guards are in residence or assigned to duty in the district.

**Desc:** Officers of the Watch march to and fro, others stand at attention, and still others drill for combat. Shouted commands and marching songs fi ll the air.

#### Places of Interest
- **Dol Arrah temple**

##### Sword Point Garrison
This sprawling complex links five adjacent towers into an enormous fortress-like structure. Thick walls crowned with battlements connect the towers along the periphery, while a huge platform connects all five towers to form an open yard for drills, all a half-mile above the ground. The ranking officer at Sword Point, [[Commander Belew Yorgan]] is a harsh but effective leader. He tries to curry favor with the Citadel, the dragon marked houses, the city council, and the temple leadership all at the same time. As a direct result, he commits most of his resources and attention to the Upper and Middle Central districts, leaving Lower Central under protected and Northedge practically ignored.

### Tradefair
A merchant district offering legal goods and services of modest to comfortable quality.

**Desc:** This district is awash in colorful signs and tents. The shouts of barkers rise above the noise of shoppers, and a dozen scents—from sweet perfumes to sizzling meats—fi ll the air.

#### Places of Interest
- **Open-air market**
- **Kol Korran temple**

##### Tradefair Market
Tradefair Market, the openair marketplace, operates daily during daylight hours. In contrast to other marketplaces in the city, Tradefair has regulations about stall spacing that ensure relatively straight, wide, and open (though crowded) aisles for customers to walk through. The goods available in Tradefair are generally of high quality, and an abundant number of House Cannith tinkers can be found to make repairs through mundane or magical means. A permit to sell in Tradefair Market for one day costs 1 gp, which certainly guarantees a certain level of quality among the merchants present, and keeps the market from becoming overcrowded.
