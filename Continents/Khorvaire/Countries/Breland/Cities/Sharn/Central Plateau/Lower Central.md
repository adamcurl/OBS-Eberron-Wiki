## NPCs

### Councilor Sava Kharisa (human F NG) 

*   The outspoken councilor from Lower Central. Since taking her seat, she has fought to improve conditions for the lower classes of Sharn, and she has made many enemies on the council and beyond. 


*   Sava is the most radical and outspoken member of the council, and has advocated further fighting against corruption and for Sharn to be recognized as an independent province. These positions put her in danger of being targeted by the Boromar Clan, but her excellent reputation, powerful connections, and popularity have kept her safe so far. Sava also owns Sava's Gallery, a trendy art gallery in the Granite Halls district of the Lower Central ward.
