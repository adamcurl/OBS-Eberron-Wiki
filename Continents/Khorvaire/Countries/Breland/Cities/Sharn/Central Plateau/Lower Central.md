## About
This district is peaceful and largely residential; it’s the safest and most pleasant of the lower wards. Goods and services are largely priced for those with a comfortable lifestyle, and the Sharn Watch is plentiful and well paid. The district of Boldrei’s Hearth has many reasonably priced inns (most run by House Ghallanda), and Olladra’s Kitchen has a wide assortment of taverns and restaurants. Myshan Gardens is a residential district that caters to affluent artists, while Vallia Towers has a large community of half-elves.

## Districts

### Boldrei’s Hearth
A haven for travelers, this district contains reliable inns ranging from modest to comfortable quality.

**Desc:** Hotels, inns, and rooms for rent seem to be everywhere in this district.

#### Places of Intrests
**Boldrei Temple**
**Silver Flame Temple**

##### Marquan’s Rooms for Let
A respectable, if a bit run-down, option for longer stays in Lower Central, Marquan’s offers private rooms with a common dining room. The building is decorated with paintings, sculpture, and pottery produced by local artists, all of whom are past or present residents of Marquan’s.
The owner and sole employee, [[Kielsten Marquan]], no longer keeps the place up as well as he used to. This is because Kielsten runs a small cult devoted to a radiant idol, and his attention to his business has slipped as his activity and responsibilities within the cult have increased.

### Granite Halls
Granite Halls is one of Lower Central’s two mercantile districts. Compared to North Towers, it has more art galleries and fewer bookstores, but otherwise the two districts are very similar

**Desc:** Quirky boutiques and art galleries stand out among a host of more mundane shops.

#### Places of Intrests
**Arawai Temple**
**Kol Korran shrine**

##### Sava’s Gallery
A trendy art gallery run by [[Councilor Sava Kharisa]]

### Myshan Gardens
A residential district that caters to affluent artists.

**Desc:** Orderly collections of townhouses ring the towers of this quiet district. Children play in the streets, couples stroll arm in arm.

### North Towers
North Towers is one of Lower Central’s two mercantile districts. It has a higher concentration of bookstores than any other district in Sharn except the University District.

**Desc:** Quirky boutiques and small bookstores stand out among a host of more mundane shops.

#### Places of Intrests
**Aureon Temple**
**Kol Korran shrine**

### Olladra’s Kitchen
Neither the best nor worst Sharn has to offer, Olladra’s Kitchen is home to a wide number of taverns and restaurants of modest to comfortable quality.

**Desc:** Conversation wafts from the open doors of a half-dozen taverns and restaurants, and the tantalizing aroma of food fi lls the air.

#### Places of Intrests
**Olladra Temple**

##### Ellfate’s Eatery
Ellfate’s is a small restaurant at the base of Skysedge Tower. It specializes in omelets, with a menu including the Blood of Vol (an omelet made with Karrnathi sausage and red pepper sauce), the Skyway Special (a very light and fl uffy dessert omelet served atop whipped cream), and the Eldeen Banquet (loaded with vegetables).
It is also a favorite meeting place for zealous mercantilists, a group of political revolutionaries who would like to see the king overthrown and replaced by a governing council of merchant-princes. Though their ideals are similar to the secret agenda of the Aurum, this group is all bluster and no action, and has no connection to the Aurum.

### Vallia Towers
Has a large community of half-elves.

**Desc:** Similar to the Myshan Gardens
