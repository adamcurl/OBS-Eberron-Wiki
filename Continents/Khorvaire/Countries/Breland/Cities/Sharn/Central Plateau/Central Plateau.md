[[Sharn]]

## Things To Do

Looking for work or amusement in this quarter? Some of the things you can do here include:


*   **Attend an auction.** The Aurora Gallery in Platinum Heights is the finest auction house in Sharn and specializes in auctions of exotic magic items and relics from Xen’drik. You never know what’s going to be available—or who will be bidding against you.


*   **Plan a heist.** Perhaps your goals depend on recovering an item a villain has hidden in the vaults of Korranath. Can you penetrate the most secure facility in Sharn?


*   **Go to jail. **The King’s Citadel in Ambassador Towers is also Sharn’s high-security prison.


*   **Worship.** The primary temples of the Sovereign Host and the Silver Flame are located in Middle Central, along with a host of shrines to specific sovereigns and lesser faiths. Take part in a festival or drop in for some spiritual guidance!


*   **Engage in espionage.** Whether you work for your nation or get entangled in the schemes of the dragonmarked houses, Middle Central is home to a lot of powerful people who have a use for capable agents.
