## About
Gold and power flow down from Upper Central. The district of Highest Towers is the seat of government, where city hall and the municipal archives are located. The Korranath is the name of both the central financial district and the grand temple of Kol Korran that dominates it. This district also houses the Kundarak Bank of Sharn and the Vaults, House Kundarak’s ostensibly impenetrable storage facility.

Some of Sharn’s wealthiest citizens live in the Mithral Tower district, and Platinum Heights is the most expensive market district in Sharn. It has fewer shops than the Bazaar of Dura, but if you’re looking for top-quality goods or services, there’s no finer—or more expensive—source to be found.

If you maintain no better than a poor lifestyle, many people in Upper Central will assume you’re a servant or vagrant; this could cause you to have disadvantage on Charisma checks involving residents.

## Districts

### Highest Towers
The seat of city government, this district is also where airships arrive and depart.

**Desc:** The lofty and ornate towers of this district offer panoramic views of the surrounding city. People stride along well-lit streets and gracefully arcing bridges with an air of importance and the smell of great wealth.

##### City Archive
This enormous edifice holds the historical and legal records of Sharn and the surrounding regions. Copies of birth records, marriage rolls, and death certifi cates are kept in the archives, as well as property records, copies of letters of marque, and records of identifi - cation papers issued in the city. Agents of the Citadel have unrestricted access to the records, and other characters with contacts in the government or in a dragonmarked house might be able to gain access to a specific set of records for a single use by calling in a favor.


##### Council Hall
Sharn’s seventeen-member city council meets at the top of Sun Tower. Surrounded by a colonnaded gallery and crowned by an observation deck, the council hall offers some of the most spectacular views in the city. The council meets weekly, and an elite troop of soldiers (privately employed by the council) guards the hall during meetings. When the council is not in session, the hall is a tourist attraction, though aides and lesser bureaucrats bustle through its lower halls unceasingly.


##### Lyrandar Tower
All airship travel to and from Sharn passes through the docking spires of Lyrandar Tower, the house’s primary enclave in Sharn. Skycoaches linger here to carry arriving passengers to other destinations in the city, along with guides hoping to win contracts for work in the city. Of Sharn’s three arrival points (including the waterfront and the Orien lightning rail station in Lower Tavick’s Landing), this is by far the least busy, as well as the safest.


### Korranath
Named for the great temple of Kol Korran that lies at its center, this district is dedicated to wealth and finance. Moneychangers, banks, and grand vaults are found here, in addition to the estates of powerful merchants.

**Desc:** There doesn’t seem to be anyone here who is not wealthy, and the whole district seems to be set up as a shrine to money itself. Every shop sells only the fi nest goods, each huge house is impeccably maintained, and the sound of money changing hands fi lls the air. Even the guards—who are everywhere—seem well off.

#### Places of Interest
- **Banks**

##### The Korranath
The temple of Kol Korran is an ostentatious display of wealth and a popular tourist attraction, since many believe praying at the Korranath ensures success in business.

Surrounded by a grand colonnade, the interior of the temple rises in a grand dome a hundred feet across covered with gold leaf and studded with precious gems. The tiles in the mosaic fl oor are made of precious stones as well, and all the sacral objects inside the temple are solid gold.

##### Kundarak Bank of Sharn
This is the largest bank in Sharn and the center of House Kundarak urban operations in the city.

[[Daphanë d’Kundarak]] is the leader of the Kundarak Enclave in Sharn and the president of the bank. She divides her time between the house enclave in Dragon Towers (in Middle Central) and the bank, but favors the bank.

##### The Vaults
Located below the Kundarak Bank, the Vaults are Kundarak’s heavily guarded storage facility.

House Kundarak offers storage space for small- to mediumsized items of great value with the highest possible security, at a cost of 15 gp per month (which includes insurance against theft). This is for long-term storage.

##### Wayfinder Foundation
The guildhall for this legendary association of explorers.

The Foundation liaison in Sharn is [[Hendra ir’Kavay]], a wealthy socialite whose interest in ancient history is largely fi nancial.

### Platinum Heights
Catering to Sharn’s elite, this district provides a wide range of shops and services of wealthy to aristocratic quality.

**Desc:** Stores, restaurants, hotels, and a few homes in this prosperous neighborhood are all high-priced and lavish.

#### Places of Interest

##### Aurora Gallery
The most prestigious auction house in Sharn, Aurora deals in magic items, exotic finds from Xen’drik, and other wonders.

When buying items at auction, characters should expect to pay between 80% and 140% (2d4+6 × 10%) of normal market price.

Its wines come from all over the world, and Sannid’s proudly offers Aerenal spirits to its most selective customers.

[[Jaetha Sannid]] is the third-generation owner and head chef of the restaurant, a sophisticated and charming middle-aged woman with silvered auburn hair.

### Mithral Tower
Where some of Sharn’s wealthiest citizens live.

**Desc:** The homes in this district are large and well kept, showing clear signs of great wealth. True to the district’s name, many of the houses boast mithral fi ligree.

### Skysedge Park
Home to three sprawling rooftop parks, this district provides a touch of wilderness in the heart of the city. A small community of immigrants from the Eldeen Reaches maintains these groves and gardens.

Skysedge Park is Sharn’s only park district, though Shae Lias (in Upper Northedge) is similar in some ways. Here, three large parks occupy the top fl oors of some of the largest towers—grass and trees grow in a deep layer of earth atop the towers, artifi cial ponds carved into the surface shimmer invitingly, and the noise of the city are magically dampened.

**Desc:** A park seems impossible in this city of towers, but grass and trees actually grow from the tops of a few towers in this district. A colossal iron statue looks over the entire area.

#### Places of Interests
- **Arawai temple**
- **Balinor temple**
- **Gatekeepers druidic site**

##### Skysedge Park
The largest of the three parks in this district gave its name to the whole district. Skysedge Tower stands near Highest Towers and Mithral Tower, and contains upscale businesses just below the park. The park is beautifully landscaped, with gently sloping earth and well-tended grass, small fruit trees, and three small ponds. At the entrance to the park, a 100-foot-tall iron statue stands watch. Called the Iron Guardian, it was crafted centuries ago by the artisans of House Cannith. Legends tell that it is a construct crafted for use in the War of the Mark, but it has not been seen to move in the recorded history of the modern city.

##### The Gatehouse
In Carosten Park, near the edge of the plateau, stands a small stone building. Passersby generally assume the building belongs to the park caretakers and pay it no heed, but it is actually a sacred site to the sect of druids known as the Gatekeepers. From this small shrine in the midst of a “natural” site in the City of Towers, the Gate keepers monitor the manifest zone, the sewers and ruins below, and the activity of powerful spellcasters in Sharn to ensure that no dangerous planar breach appears in the city. They are not overly concerned with ordinary summoning spells and have little worry that the angels of Syrania are planning an invasion of the Material Plane, but they are deeply worried about recent events in the Depths.
