[[Central Plateau]]

## About
Gold and power flow down from Upper Central. The district of Highest Towers is the seat of government, where city hall and the municipal archives are located. The Korranath is the name of both the central financial district and the grand temple of Kol Korran that dominates it. This district also houses the Kundarak Bank of Sharn and the Vaults, House Kundarak’s ostensibly impenetrable storage facility.

Some of Sharn’s wealthiest citizens live in the Mithral Tower district, and Platinum Heights is the most expensive market district in Sharn. It has fewer shops than the Bazaar of Dura, but if you’re looking for top-quality goods or services, there’s no finer—or more expensive—source to be found.

If you maintain no better than a poor lifestyle, many people in Upper Central will assume you’re a servant or vagrant; this could cause you to have disadvantage on Charisma checks involving residents.
