[[Sharn]]

## About
Cliffside encompasses the docks and waterfront of Sharn, running along the edge of the Dagger River and up the cliff above it. Massive lifts levitate goods up to the skydocks in the district of Precarious. The area’s rough and poor, filled with sailors and dockworkers. Many of these boisterous folk love the life in Cliffside; as a common saying goes, “Better a tankard of ale in Cliffside than a barrel of Central wine.”

Plenty of legitimate services can be found here—ships need supplies and repairs, goods need to be stored, captains need to hire crew, and sailors need a dry bed to sleep in once in a while—but other businesses meet different kinds of demands. These services include bordellos, taverns, gaming dens, and shadier entertainments for sailors to spend their off duty hours and wages on.

Even though the Sharn Watch has a token presence here, Cliffside remains one of the most crime-ridden districts in the city. This situation is exacerbated by the presence of sahuagin, who sell their services as guides to help ships traveling to Xen’drik. In fact, the sahuagin rarely initiate violence, but there have been clashes between them and aggressive, drunken sailors.


## Districts

### Cliffside
Boats bring cargo and passengers to the dock at Cliffside, on the edge of the Dagger River. From there, enormous lifts carry people up to Precarious. This dangerous district contains an assortment of taverns, shabby inns, and warehouses.


#### Mud Caves
This shantytown sits on the edge of Cliffside, where generations of destitute people have carved out homes in the cliff walls. It’s a wretched existence, but most of the inhabitants have no other options. It also makes an excellent hiding place for fugitives.


#### Sharn’s Welcome
Also known as the docks of Cliffside, this area is rough and dirty. Its taverns frequently host brawls, while the inns offer travelers a wide variety of ways to be cheated or robbed.


#### Ship’s Towers
Drifting alongside the Cliffside docks is a collection of rafts, ships, and houseboats lashed together to form a floating community.
