## About
The Cliffside ward makes up the lower edge of Dura and encompasses the docks and waterfront of Sharn, running along the edge of the Dagger River and up the cliff above it. Massive lifts levitate goods up to the skydocks in the district of Precarious. The area’s rough and poor, filled with sailors and dockworkers. Many of these boisterous folk love the life in Cliffside; as a common saying goes, “Better a tankard of ale in Cliffside than a barrel of Central wine.”

Plenty of legitimate services can be found here—ships need supplies and repairs, goods need to be stored, captains need to hire crew, and sailors need a dry bed to sleep in once in a while—but other businesses meet different kinds of demands. These services include bordellos, taverns, gaming dens, and shadier entertainments for sailors to spend their off duty hours and wages on.

Even though the Sharn Watch has a token presence here, Cliffside remains one of the most crime-ridden districts in the city. This situation is exacerbated by the presence of sahuagin, who sell their services as guides to help ships traveling to Xen’drik. In fact, the sahuagin rarely initiate violence, but there have been clashes between them and aggressive, drunken sailors.

Boats bring cargo and passengers to the dock at Cliffside, on the edge of the Dagger River. From there, enormous lifts carry people up to Precarious. This dangerous district contains an assortment of taverns, shabby inns, and warehouses.


## Districts

### Grayflood
Grayflood, a seedy waterfront district, fi lls roughly the northern half of the docks and wharves running along the Dagger River. Gigantic cranes empowered by magic haul freight from ships at dock to the warehouse districts of Precarious and White Tower, while the crews of those ships restock and recharge at the shops and taverns that line the bottom of the great cliffs.

**Desc:** Most of the traffic here consists of sailors in search of entertainment. Bars, flophouses, and small shops—many of which don’t bother to advertise the nature of their business—line the street, which winds precariously along the edge of a steep cliff overlooking the river.

### Mud Caves
This shantytown sits on the edge of Cliffside, where generations of destitute people have carved out homes in the cliff walls. It’s a wretched existence, but most of the inhabitants have no other options. It also makes an excellent hiding place for fugitives.

**Desc:** Lean-tos, smoky fires, and makeshift hovels cling to the side of the cliff and spread into tiny caves in the great rock wall.

### Sharn’s Welcome
Also known as the docks of Cliffside, this area is rough and dirty. Its taverns frequently host brawls, while the inns offer travelers a wide variety of ways to be cheated or robbed.

**Desc:** Raucous sailors stagger through the streets in groups of threes and fives, careening from tavern to bordello in search of a good time.

### Ship’s Towers
Drifting alongside the Cliffside docks is a collection of rafts, ships, and houseboats lashed together to form a floating community.

**Desc:** Much like Grayflood.
