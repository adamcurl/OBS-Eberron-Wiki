## About

This ward is effectively a self-contained city catering to the nobles that live there. It has fine housing, skilled services, a luxurious mercantile district, and even an entire district—Sunrise—designed for the servants of the nobles. The services and lodging in Sunrise accommodate those with poor or modest lifestyles, as opposed to the higher-priced goods found elsewhere in the ward.

For those willing to put up with its restrictive laws, Upper Tavick’s Landing has many fine features. Wyredd’s Spirits is the best source for wine in Sharn. The shop Crystals of Denion buys and sells rare magic items, though it only has a handful of such items at any given time. Transmutation is a renowned beauty salon providing both mundane and arcane services. House Deneith maintains a fortified garrison and training facility in the Copper Arch district.


### The Laws of Upper Tavick’s Landing

During the war, fears of attacks by foreign agents resulted in the establishment of a number of laws here that affect visitors, including adventurers, to this day.

* The soldiers of House Deneith have full authority to act as agents of the Sharn Watch in Upper Tavick’s Landing, and staff of Deneith’s elite Blademark mercenaries maintain checkpoints at the district’s edges.
* You need a license to carry a weapon in Upper Tavick’s Landing. It costs only 5 gp, but you have to plead your case to a clerk. Any Blademark or member of the watch can demand to see your license and might confiscate unauthorized weapons. You also need a license to cast spells in the ward. It costs 10 gp, and you must specify the spells you intend to cast. A fine can be levied for any unauthorized use of magic. To get licenses for weapons or spellcasting, you’ll have to go to the courthouse in the Twelve Pillars district.
* Another law requires inhabitants to dress “in a manner that upholds the solemn dignity of this proud ward.” Blademarks and officers of the watch can choose how they interpret this. Typically, armor is considered inappropriate unless you’re tied to House Deneith or the Sharn Watch, or you’ve served with the Brelish military. Anyone in contempt of this law is escorted out.
* Any sort of unruly behavior—fighting, shouting in the streets, and the like—brings a fine of up to 5 gp and temporary expulsion from the ward.
