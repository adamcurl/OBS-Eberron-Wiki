## About

This ward is effectively a self-contained city catering to the nobles that live there. It has fine housing, skilled services, a luxurious mercantile district, and even an entire district—Sunrise—designed for the servants of the nobles. The services and lodging in Sunrise accommodate those with poor or modest lifestyles, as opposed to the higher-priced goods found elsewhere in the ward.

For those willing to put up with its restrictive laws, Upper Tavick’s Landing has many fine features. Wyredd’s Spirits is the best source for wine in Sharn. The shop Crystals of Denion buys and sells rare magic items, though it only has a handful of such items at any given time. Transmutation is a renowned beauty salon providing both mundane and arcane services. House Deneith maintains a fortified garrison and training facility in the Copper Arch district.


### The Laws of Upper Tavick’s Landing
During the war, fears of attacks by foreign agents resulted in the establishment of a number of laws here that affect visitors, including adventurers, to this day.

* The soldiers of House Deneith have full authority to act as agents of the Sharn Watch in Upper Tavick’s Landing, and staff of Deneith’s elite Blademark mercenaries maintain checkpoints at the district’s edges.
* You need a license to carry a weapon in Upper Tavick’s Landing. It costs only 5 gp, but you have to plead your case to a clerk. Any Blademark or member of the watch can demand to see your license and might confiscate unauthorized weapons. You also need a license to cast spells in the ward. It costs 10 gp, and you must specify the spells you intend to cast. A fine of 50 gp per level of the spell can be levied for any unauthorized use of magic. To get licenses for weapons or spellcasting, you’ll have to go to the courthouse in the Twelve Pillars district.
* Another law requires inhabitants to dress “in a manner that upholds the solemn dignity of this proud ward.” Blademarks and officers of the watch can choose how they interpret this. Typically, armor is considered inappropriate unless you’re tied to House Deneith or the Sharn Watch, or you’ve served with the Brelish military. Anyone in contempt of this law is escorted out.
* Any sort of unruly behavior—fighting, shouting in the streets, and the like—brings a fine of up to 5 gp and temporary expulsion from the ward.

## Districts

### Copper Arch
This district is built around the Deneith garrison that polices the upper ward. It contains shops and services catering to the wealthy elite.

**Desc:** A massive copper arch stretches over the center of this business district. The streets are fi lled with well-to-do citizens and professionals, conducting business or heading to their homes and offi ces.

##### The Three Towers
A fortress enclave of House Deneith. One tower is a garrison for the Blademark mercenary forces that police Upper Tavick’s Landing. The second is dedicated to house business and training. The third is a private mansion for Deneith heirs, and it is here that the Deneith hone their psionic abilities and practice psionic combat. If a Deneith heir from outside Sharn tries to enter the facility, she is told that the enclave is restricted and directed to the main enclave in Dragon Towers.

##### Magical Pigments
A gallery displaying paintings by local artists.

##### Transmutation
A beauty salon that employs both magical and mundane cosmetic techniques.

##### Wyredd’s Spirits
Wyredd deals in fine wines and exotic spirits. Wyredd’s has the finest selection in Sharn, but his prices are high.

### Dalan’s Refuge
Dalan’s Refuge is rather unremarkable, notable only for the wealth of its inhabitants, the number of pretentious monuments it contains, and the fact that a wouldbe resident only needs to acquire 25 signatures before purchasing property in the district. It is fi lled with impressive mansions, along with a few smaller houses belonging to successful merchants, barristers, and politicians who haven’t quite made it to the top yet.

**Desc:** The opulence of this neighborhood is overwhelming. The streets are lined with marble statues of famous inhabitants of Sharn, and fountains of illusion throw shimmering columns of rainbow light into the air. While not quite as luxurious as the homes of Ocean View, the mansions of Dalan’s Refuge are large and quite impressive.

### Ocean View
The manors of Ocean View are the most luxurious on the east side of Sharn, and they are extremely exclusive. Gold alone cannot purchase a mansion in Ocean View; by the laws of the ward, at least 30 current residents must sign a petition allowing the newcomer to purchase property. In addition to the beautiful homes, there are a number of pleasant parks and public gardens. The most notable of these is Lavalla Park, which provides the best view of the ocean.

**Desc:** The towers of Ocean View are among the highest in the city, allowing a beautiful view of the water to the south. The central spires are surrounded by luxurious mansions and well-kept gardens. Private guards stand at the gates of most of the manors, and strangers are watched carefully.

#### Places of Interest

##### The Gray House
This manor is one of the oldest in the district, and it has a few unusual features; most notably, it has no windows. The outlines of windows have been engraved into the outer walls, but the walls are solid; apparently the architect considered it to be some sort of artistic statement. The Gray House has passed through the hands of a number of Karrnathi nobles over the last three centuries. While the people of Ocean View generally distrust foreigners, the inhabitants of the Gray House are invariably charming and charismatic—and vampires. The Gray House has long been used as a safe house for undead associated with the Order of the Emerald Claw. The current lady of the house is [[Jesel Tarra’az]]. She spends most of her time tending to her “family investments,” but occasionally appears at evening galas or other after-dark events.

### Pinnacle
The temples of Pinnacle serve more of a social function than a religious one. The priests are typically experts with no divine abilities. The primary duties of a Pinnacle priest are managing donations, ensuring that the people who pay the most get prominent seating during services, and performing formal (if ultimately meaningless) blessings at the parties and galas of the wealthy. The one exception is the Temple of Balinor; while it happens to have been built in Pinnacle, its priests are dedicated and its services draw the faithful from across Sharn.

**Desc:** While not quite as impressive as the grand temples at Sovereign Towers, the churches and shrines of Pinnacle are dripping with precious metals and jewels. Appearance and opulence may be more important than faith to the congregations of Pinnacle.

### Silvergate
This shopping district is patronized by those with gold to spare. All manner of fine jewelry and expensive clothing can be found here, along with aristocratic food and lodging.

There are four different dining clubs in Silvergate, but they only accept members from wealthy families or dragonmarked houses.

**Desc:** The streets of the district are paved with silver stone, and gleam in the light of the everbright lanterns. Beautiful music wafts out of an expensive restaurant, and a young aristocrat examines a glamerweave cloak with a critical eye.

#### Places of Interest

##### Crystals of Denion
This gallery deals in rare and expensive magic items. The selection is limited, and Denion looks for items that are both beautiful and powerful. Most of Denion’s goods are related to charm effects or enhancing Charisma. He also has a variety of extremely expensive magical art; while fascinating and beautiful, these have no practical value for adventurers. Items purchased in Silvergate are always of exceptional quality, but generally have a 5% markup on price.

### Sunrise
This district provides housing for the shopkeepers and servants who keep Upper Tavick’s Landing running. Housing is largely modest in quality, with a few comfortable towers.

**Desc:** The few mansions in this district are on the east side, where they get the best view of the sunrise over the cliffs. Most of the people in this neighborhood are successful, but not tremendously wealthy; they are the shopkeepers, hirelings, and servants who see to the needs of the rich and powerful inhabitants of the quarter.

### Twelve Pillars
This is the civic heart of Upper Tavick’s Landing. The twelve pillars it’s named for surround a courthouse, the Tower of Law, where visitors can get licenses to carry weapons in the ward.

All work and no play means you have come to Twelve Pillars. The inhabitants of this district are serious about what they do, and are generally quite good at their trades. The exotic trades include a calligrapher; an importer of (legal) Riedran goods, notably sculptures; and a dealer in exotic cheeses. The district derives its name from the courthouse at its center, a structure surrounded by twelve massive pillars, each made from a different type of stone. Each pillar is topped with a statue of one of the Lord Mayors of Sharn. As the pillars are all filled, there has been some discussion as to how to honor the more recent mayors.

**Desc:** A host of small businesses are interspersed with pleasant houses and a few manor towers. Barristers, architects, scribes, translators, and members of other skilled professions offer their services here, along with a few more exotic—and expensive—trades.

##### Twelve Pillars Courthouse
This is where people need to go to acquire licenses to carry weapons or use magic within Upper Tavick’s Landing. The primary clerk who deals with suspicious individuals is an old dwarf named [[Billan Tosh]]. Billan is an expert at spotting forgeries, and has Forgery +13, Sense Motive +14, Spot +14, and a Will save of +9. He also has a pair of spectacles that provide him with the benefi ts of arcane sight, and if he detects any use of magic he triggers an alarm summoning guards— so the use of charm person might backfi re. Billan is a low-level member of the Aurum, and the character’s relationship with the Aurum may affect their ability to acquire licenses; alternatively, he can offer to grant a request if the characters perform a service for the Aurum. Because of his Aurum connections, he proves diffi cult to bribe; he is well paid for his services.

The spymaster of the Zilargo embassy has an agent in the records department: [[Janesta Banton]], a scribe and clerk. As a result, the gnomes can easily gain access to the many details people must provide to obtain a license.
