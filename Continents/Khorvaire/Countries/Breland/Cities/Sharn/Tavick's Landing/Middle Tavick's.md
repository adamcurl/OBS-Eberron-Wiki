[[Tavick's Landing]]

## About
Unlike the upper ward, Middle Tavick’s Landing welcomes travelers and tourists. The ward features a host of lively taverns and excellent inns. The Cornerstone is a huge arena that hosts events ranging from circuses to aerial jousting. The Deathsgate district caters to adventurers, much as the Clifftop district of Upper Dura does. Like Clifftop, the district has an adventurer’s guild—though the Deathsgate Guild has a dark reputation, and its members often pick fights with Clifftop adventurers. (See the “[Adventurer’s Guilds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/erftlw/sharn-city-of-towers#AdventurersGuilds)” section for more information.) House Jorasco has a large house of healing in the ward, and House Deneith maintains a recruiting station for would-be mercenaries.

The Graystone district has deep roots in Karrnathi culture that predate the Last War; Slogar’s and the Bloody Mug are places where homesick Karrns can enjoy blood sausage and Nightwood ale. The district is a haven for Karrnathi soldiers who want to avoid Brelish aggression and a place where followers of the Blood of Vol can practice their faith.

Tavick’s Market is one of Sharn’s major market districts; located directly above the Terminus lightning rail station, it’s filled with stands selling produce and goods brought in by local farmers.


## Districts

### Cornerstone
A haven for travelers, Cornerstone has a range of comfortable inns and taverns. It’s built around the vast Cornerstone arena and is a center of activity for many major sporting events.


#### The Cornerstone

A comfortable tavern devoted to the sport of hrazhak. Most of the clientele are shifters, but anyone willing to talk hrazhak will find friends here.


### Deathsgate
Named for the nearby City of the Dead, this district houses the Deathsgate Guild and businesses that cater to adventurers. House Deneith recruits mercenaries at its outpost here.

A society where adventurers can hone their skills and seek profitable work. The Deathsgate Guild has a sinister reputation, earned because its members will do anything in pursuit of success.

### Graywall
This district was founded long ago by Karrnathi immigrants, and its people are proud of their heritage. It is a haven for any Karrnathi travelers passing through Sharn. Rumors say there’s a temple devoted to the Blood of Vol in Graywall, but if that’s the case, it’s kept hidden.


#### The Bloody Mug
A comfortable tavern catering to Sharn’s Karrnathi immigrants. Travelers from Karrnath always receive a warm welcome and a tankard of nightwood ale in exchange for stories from the old country.


#### Slogar’s
This modest restaurant serves traditional Karrnathi cuisine. The ambience is a bit gloomy, but the prices are reasonable, and the food is very filling.
