[[Sharn]]

## About
Everyone who comes to Sharn, whether by land or air, passes through Tavick’s Landing. The quarter took on a martial aspect during the Last War, and the tense atmosphere can still be felt today. On the positive side, Watch Commander Iyanna ir’Talan has gone to great efforts to purge corruption in the local garrisons of the Sharn Watch; as a result, this is one of the few districts where the Watch is both helpful and competent. On the downside, visitors from any nation that fought against Breland during the war might be greeted with suspicion or hostility.


## Things to Do:
As a metropolitan district filled with immigrants, merchants, and travelers from across Khorvaire and beyond it, Tavick’s Landing offers a host of opportunities to enjoy food and entertainment from distant lands. Or you might find yourself here for one of a few specific reasons, such as:

* **Take a chance.** The Dragoneyes district is filled with ways to lose your wages, both in established gambling halls and on street corners. If you you’re looking for something a little more exotic, see if you can find Chance. This is the name both of a secret, roaming gambling den and of the changeling who runs it. In addition to offering all manner of mundane games and bets, Chance is said to be able to arrange and cover nearly any sort of wager or duel. Are you ready to gamble with a fiend? Would you wager a year of your life for a moment of good fortune when you need it the most? If any of the rumors are true, these are examples of what’s possible at Chance.
* **Find refuge.** Though most of the refugees in High Walls come from Cyre, the district is a haven for anyone displaced in the war, including Brelish. The place is overcrowded, however, and resources are stretched thin. Tensions are high, and feuds and power struggles among the refugees take place regularly. If you’re from Cyre, you might be able to find a cot in High Walls, especially if you already have friends or family living there.
* **Bond over blood.** The Graystone district in Middle Tavick’s Landing is one of the few places in Breland where the Blood of Vol religion is practiced openly. Residents are circumspect about their activities, and undead servants are largely kept off the streets. But if you’re a follower of the faith, it’s a place where you can participate in the Sacrament of the Blood or consult with a priest. It’s also the best place to find a skilled necromancer, or to hear rumors about the latest schemes of the Order of the Emerald Claw.
