[[Tavick's Landing]]

## About
Two land routes to Sharn both end at Lower Tavick’s Landing. The Orien lightning rail deposits passengers in the district of Terminus, while those who travel to Sharn on the Old Road arrive at Wroann’s Gate. Getting to the better parts of Sharn from here means passing through Black Arch, a heavily fortified garrison district designed to repel enemies and withstand a full siege. The ward offers a variety of services catering to travelers; the Dragoneyes district is a maze of taverns, inns, brothels, and gambling halls. Dragoneyes is also noteworthy for being the site of one of the few changeling communities in Breland.

House Orien has a strong presence in Lower Tavick’s Landing, and Orien heirs, laborers, and teamsters can be found in many of the districts. House Lyrandar and House Deneith are also well represented, with their representatives arranging matters of trade, transport, and security.

These days, Lower Tavick’s Landing is best known for High Walls, a former residential district converted into a home for refugees from the Last War. High Walls is filled past capacity, mostly by Cyrans who were displaced by the Mourning. The gates are open at present, but High Walls is designed to serve as a fortress prison if the need arises, and the Sharn Watch keeps an eye out for any signs of unrest.


## Districts

### Black Arch
This district is filled with checkpoints and enchanted gates. These portals are generally open, but in times of trouble, Black Arch can become an impassable fortress. The Sharn Watch maintains the local garrison. House Orien and House Sivis both maintain outposts here, ensuring that messages can be swiftly delivered through the city and beyond.


### Cogsgate
This warehouse district is the gateway to the Cogs, and shipments of ore and other goods regularly pass through here. House Kundarak has high-security storage facilities for rent, and a House Deneith outpost hires out Blademark mercenaries for venturing below.


### Dragoneyes
Dragoneyes tends to the needs of weary travelers, providing a wide range of lodging, food, and entertainment for tourists. It’s also the home of most of Sharn’s changeling population, and many changelings use their gifts to entertain and amuse travelers. Some say that it’s the home of the Tyrants criminal guild, but if so, that place is well hidden.


#### Chance
A legendary gambling hall. In addition to standard games, it’s said that the host can cover a wide range of unusual wagers.


#### Velvet’s
Staffed by changelings, this comfortable inn specializes in fulfilling fantasies; both the staff and the rooms can be adapted to fit any scenario. Though some clients have romance in mind, others come to Velvet’s to relive triumphs, to prepare for debates or trials, or for help in developing a new identity.


### High Walls
This district was converted into an internment center during the Last War. Since the end of the war, it has been transformed into a refugee camp. Most of the residents are Cyrans who fled the Mourning, but High Walls also includes Brelish citizens who lost their homes in the war. It’s a crowded and dangerous place, but it allows residents to maintain a squalid lifestyle at no cost. Currently the gates are open, but the Sharn Watch could seal them at any time.


### Terminus
This district is based around Terminus Station, where the lightning rail enters and leaves Sharn. Most local businesses serve the station or travelers.


#### Terminus Station
An enclave of House Orien, this site contains the lightning rail station. The administrators coordinate the many Orien caravans that come and go from Sharn. Many of the other dragonmarked houses have small outposts in or around Terminus Station, allowing travelers to immediately access the services of House Sivis, House Deneith, and others.


### Wroann’s Gate
Travelers who arrive on the main road enter Sharn through Wroann’s Gate, passing below a huge statue of the legendary Queen Wroaan. Many of the dragonmarked houses maintain shops here so travelers can send messages, hire bodyguards, or make use of other services.
