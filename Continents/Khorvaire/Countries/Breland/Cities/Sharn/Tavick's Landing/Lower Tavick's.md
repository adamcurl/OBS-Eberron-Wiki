## About
Two land routes to Sharn both end at Lower Tavick’s Landing. The Orien lightning rail deposits passengers in the district of Terminus, while those who travel to Sharn on the Old Road arrive at Wroann’s Gate. Getting to the better parts of Sharn from here means passing through Black Arch, a heavily fortified garrison district designed to repel enemies and withstand a full siege. The ward offers a variety of services catering to travelers; the Dragoneyes district is a maze of taverns, inns, brothels, and gambling halls. Dragoneyes is also noteworthy for being the site of one of the few changeling communities in Breland.

House Orien has a strong presence in Lower Tavick’s Landing, and Orien heirs, laborers, and teamsters can be found in many of the districts. House Lyrandar and House Deneith are also well represented, with their representatives arranging matters of trade, transport, and security.

These days, Lower Tavick’s Landing is best known for High Walls, a former residential district converted into a home for refugees from the Last War. High Walls is filled past capacity, mostly by Cyrans who were displaced by the Mourning. The gates are open at present, but High Walls is designed to serve as a fortress prison if the need arises, and the Sharn Watch keeps an eye out for any signs of unrest.


## Districts

### Black Arch

^2f570c

This district is filled with checkpoints and enchanted gates. These portals are generally open, but in times of trouble, Black Arch can become an impassable fortress. The Sharn Watch maintains the local garrison. House Orien and House Sivis both maintain outposts here, ensuring that messages can be swiftly delivered through the city and beyond.

The Watch assigned to Black Arch takes its job very seriously, and its members are among the most ethical and trustworthy to be found in Sharn, mostly due to the efforts of the district commander, [[Commander Iyanna ir’Talan]]. Most of the trades and services in this district support the Watch. There are a host of smithies, and it is an excellent place to obtain masterwork weapons and armor. House Jorasco maintains a house of healing near the garrison tower.

This district is also the headquarters for the Guardians of the Gate.

**Desc:** This district was designed to withstand a full siege. Every bridge to the outer realms has a guard post and a heavy portcullis that can be lowered at a moment’s notice. The walls are unusually thick stone, and arrow slits and murder holes can be seen in every wall. A massive tower of black stone dominates the center of the district—the garrison of the Sharn Watch, and the city’s fi rst line of defense against outside attack.

### Cogsgate
This warehouse district is the gateway to the Cogs, and shipments of ore and other goods regularly pass through here. House Kundarak has high-security storage facilities for rent, and a House Deneith outpost hires out Blademark mercenaries for venturing below.

The Guardians of the Gate and the Wharf Watch both perform customs investigations, and there are three tariff offices where merchants can pay the taxes levied on their goods, or where local landowners can come to pay their taxes to the Brelish Crown. After customs inspections, goods are usually stored in one of the many warehouses until they can be distributed throughout the city or transported to the docks.

One new area of tension revolves around the war between the Boromar Clan and the criminal organization known as Daask. The Boromars have financial interests in many of the warehouses, and the monsters of Daask have been striking Boromar holdings across the city. To date, Cogsgate has been left largely untouched, but at any time a Daask commando force could emerge from Blackbone to strike against a Boromar holding.

**Desc:** This district is filled with sturdy warehouses and storage towers. Teamsters and laborers haul goods to and from storage vaults. A sulfurous smell wafts up from the shafts that lead to the Cogs far below.

##### House Deneith
Visiting merchants may have concerns about the safety of their goods—or their skins. There is a small House Deneith outpost in this district where travelers can arrange for additional warehouse security, long-term bodyguards, or shortterm escorts to the higher levels of the city.

##### House Kundarak
The House of Warding maintains five high-security warehouses in this district, each protected by arcane seal, alarm, glyphs of warding, and other mundane and magic traps. The price is twice that of the other warehouses in Cogsgate, but this all but ensures that the goods are protected.

### Dragoneyes

^7b1fcd

Dragoneyes tends to the needs of weary travelers, providing a wide range of lodging, food, and entertainment for tourists. It’s also the home of most of Sharn’s changeling population, and many changelings use their gifts to entertain and amuse travelers. Some say that it’s the home of the Tyrants criminal guild, but if so, that place is well hidden.

The streets are full of people of all races and genders offering companionship. Wise people avoid these freelance operatives— who are often thieves or con artists looking for an opportunity—and instead frequent one of the many brothels in the district. Dragoneyes also contains a handful of dream parlors, places where illusion magic is used to provide exotic entertainment.

**Desc:** This district varies dramatically from street to street, blending loud, lowbrow entertainment with more sophisticated and sensual pleasures for wealthier visitors.

##### Chance
A legendary gambling hall. In addition to standard games, it’s said that the host can cover a wide range of unusual wagers.

Dragoneyes has quite a few rowdy gambling halls, but Chance is a more sophisticated casino. In addition to running the standard games and making odds on the various races and sporting events that occur throughout the city, Chance has a reputation for being able to arrange and cover almost any bet. Can you survive for two days with House Tarkanan trying to assassinate you? Can you seduce the ambassador from Aerenal in the next 24 hours? Chance makes the odds, takes the bet, and makes the arrangements required to set the challenge in motion. The casino is owned by a doppelganger named [[Chance]], who is also a powerful priest of the Traveler. Almost nothing is known about Chance; the doppelganger wears a different guise every night, and the only way to recognize Chance is by the distinctive amulet it wears.

Chance is not an agent of the Tyrant guild. It respects the guild and may provide magical assistance to guild members, but it serves the Traveler in its own way and stands above the guilds and politics of the city.

##### Honest Faces
A cosmetics store run by The Spider, who works for the Tyrants. People can often buy information from The Spider by gold, services, or other secrets.

##### The Shifting Hall
The resources of the Tyrants are hidden throughout Dragoneyes, but they maintain a small building on the Street of Eyes where prospective clients can come in search of services. This building is completely unmarked and unremarkable. To find it, a character must obtain directions or make a DC 20 Investigation check. The Tyrant leadership is rarely found at the hall, and instead moves from base to base throughout the district.

##### Velvet’s
Staffed by changelings, this comfortable inn specializes in fulfilling fantasies; both the staff and the rooms can be adapted to fit any scenario. Though some clients have romance in mind, others come to Velvet’s to relive triumphs, to prepare for debates or trials, or for help in developing a new identity.

This luxurious inn specializes in fulfilling fantasies. While companions of all races and genders can be found here (though most are in fact doppelgangers or changelings), a client can enjoy the company of anyone he or she desires. A portrait is preferred, but [[Velvet]] can pluck images from the mind of a client, drawing out appearance, mannerisms, and other desired traits. The appearance of rooms can be adjusted to fulfill a specific scenario. While companionship is certainly sold at Velvet’s, it is not always what people want. A client may want to practice a wedding proposal. A barrister may go to Velvet’s to relive a glorious triumph in the courtroom. A lonely traveler may want to spend one night at home with his wife and family, even if they are only facsimiles. Velvet’s can make all of these happen. The cost of such elaborate scenarios is considerably higher than a standard inn or brothel, but Velvet’s does provide an experience that cannot be found anywhere else.

### Foundation
Foundation is a simple residential area, home to Cogs and caravan workers. It is a poor district, plain and unremarkable, made from bare gray stone.

**Desc:** This district is solid and unremarkable, filled with low-income housing for the people who work the Cogs and the caravan districts of Terminus and Wroann’s Gate.

### High Walls
This district was converted into an internment center during the Last War. Since the end of the war, it has been transformed into a refugee camp. Most of the residents are Cyrans who fled the Mourning, but High Walls also includes Brelish citizens who lost their homes in the war. It’s a crowded and dangerous place, but it allows residents to maintain a squalid lifestyle at no cost. Currently the gates are open, but the Sharn Watch could seal them at any time.

High Walls is a self-sufficient community. The trades and services are all refugees putting their skills to work and selling their talents. But there is still a lot of tension and anger in this district. A growing number of Cyrans have embraced the nihilistic beliefs of the Dragon Below or turned to the worship of Radiant Idols, refusing to respect gods who would allow their nation to be destroyed. Former Brelish soldiers may receive an unfriendly welcome in this district, and would be well advised to tread lightly.

**Desc:** Many of the buildings in this district are in a state of disrepair or have been vandalized. The people on the streets are haggard and worn, watching everything with suspicious eyes.

##### The Cog Carnival
The Cog Carnival is a dilapidated warforged dive bar. The bar has a crumbling stone outside marred with graffiti that says things like, “Forged Are Scrap!” and “Leave, Metalheads!” Ingot, (N warforged) soldier with a carved chunk of wood replacing a severed foot, collects a cover fee from creatures that enter the room. Warforged can enter the building for free, but other humanoids must pay 5 cp each.

Smelt (LG warforged) is the owner of the Cog Carnival. She wanted to create a safe place where warforged could gather and socialize in this district. She can’t afford the city’s expensive gambling license, so she made the Cog Carnival a place where warforged can play games for free.

**Desc:** Smoky, low flames in a fireplace barely illuminate the cracked stone walls and filthy floor of this establishment. The single-room space is crowded with warforged with severed digits or limbs, scars, burns, and other wounds. Other warforged in the area are gathered around traditional dice, card, dart, and board games as well as carnival competitions such as throwing metal rings onto posts, tossing a ball at a tower of weighted iron cups hard enough to make them fall down, and striking a homemade machine hard enough with a hammer to make it ring a bell.

A small bar in the corner serves cheap ale. Behind this bar, a warforged bartender shouts jeers at patrons losing games.

### Terminus
This district is based around Terminus Station, where the lightning rail enters and leaves Sharn. Most local businesses serve the station or travelers. It is a hotbed of activity, and despite the presence of the Sharn Watch and the Guardians of the Gate, pickpockets and other thieves operate freely.

After visitors pass inspection by the Guardians of the Gate, they are free to leave the district, either on foot or by taking one of the lifts or skycoaches to the higher wards. Terminus itself offers a host of inns, restaurants, taverns, and other basic services for the traveler who doesn’t want to enter greater Sharn, but none of these services are notable for quality or value.

**House Sivis** maintains a message station in Terminus, and there is a small **House Deneith** outpost where visitors can arrange for bodyguards or laborers. There is a larger **House Lyrandar** enclave; primarily this is used for negotiations between Lyrandar and Orien, but this outpost also allows merchants to arrange to have the goods brought in by coach transported elsewhere by air or sea. **House Vadalis** operates a large stable and hostelry, allowing visitors to secure their mounts while wandering through the city.

**Desc:** This district is a buzzing hive of activity. Orien lightning rail coaches arrive and depart twice a day, and merchants and laborers are constantly loading and unloading crates of merchandise. Skycoaches and magic lifts are in constant motion, carrying travelers up to the higher towers.

##### Terminus Station
An enclave of House Orien, this site contains the lightning rail station. The administrators coordinate the many Orien caravans that come and go from Sharn. Many of the other dragonmarked houses have small outposts in or around Terminus Station, allowing travelers to immediately access the services of House Sivis, House Deneith, and others.

### Wroann’s Gate
Travelers who arrive on the main road enter Sharn through Wroann’s Gate, passing below a huge statue of the legendary Queen Wroaan. Many of the dragonmarked houses maintain shops here so travelers can send messages, hire bodyguards, or make use of other services.

Compared to Terminus, Wroann’s Gate sees far more local traffic—farmers from the surrounding areas bringing their goods to market, lords returning from Wroat, merchant caravans, and messengers and travelers of all description. Otherwise, the two districts are very similar, and House Sivis, House Deneith, and House Vadalis all offer the same services here that they do in Terminus.

**Desc:** Hordes of people stream through the enormous gate of Sharn. A continuous flood of traffic and noise fills the streets, and skycoaches fill the air.
