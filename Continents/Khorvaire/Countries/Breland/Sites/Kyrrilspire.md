[[Breland]]
1. **Type:** Manifest Zone

The Kyrrilspire Mountain in the Blackcaps, usually visible to the southeast from Drum Keep, changes shape from day to day. It exists inside a permanent [[Kythri]] manifest zone. Some days the mountain appears as a tall, thin spire with hundred-foot-long stone thorns growing out of it, other days twisted like a unicornâ€™s horn. The mountain has also split into two or more peaks or vanished entirely on occasion. Most days, Kyrrilspire appears like a typical mountain, although small details change. Other days the mountain appears to be carved with the faces of people or animals or monsters. Rarely, the mountain is decorated with vast sections of draconic script, with letters hundreds of feet high. The changes are accompanied by tremors and often a tremendous roaring sound as earth and stone is created, destroyed, or redistributed. Characters on the mountain when a change begins suffer as if within the effects of an earthquake spell 1d4 times over the course of 2d10 minutes.
