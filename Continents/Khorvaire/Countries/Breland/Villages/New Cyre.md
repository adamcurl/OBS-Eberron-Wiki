[[Breland]]
1. **Type:** Village
2. **Population:** 4,200

What began as a refugee camp has evolved into a struggling town hosting thousands of Cyran refugees. [[Prince Oargev ir'Wynarn]] holds court in New Cyre, considering himself a king in exile. Though resources are scarce, New Cyre remains a symbol of hope for many refugees. It’s also a last stop for those determined to explore the Mournland. King Boranel took pity on the refugees and established the camps that evolved into a village and then a town.

Today, New Cyre sits on a trade road southeast of Starilaskur, in the middle of Breland’s eastern farm country. The prince of the city, Oargev ir’Wynarn, is the last son of Cyre’s ruling family. He was serving as an ambassador to Breland when the mysterious disaster befell his nation and has since become the unoffi cial leader of the Cyran refugees scattered throughout the other domains. He hopes to one day gather all of Cyre’s homeless children to this refuge in Breland. His other desire revolves around discovering the truth behind the destruction of his kin and country, and exacting revenge on the guilty parties. Until then, he graciously accepts the hospitality of Breland (even if the Brelish have given him unwanted land in the middle of nowhere) and works to rebuild the confi dence and honor of his subjects. He serves as mayor of New Cyre while also playing the role of a king in exile.

The people of New Cyre work as farmers while their prince plots and plans the future glory of the Cyran crown. Prince Oargev regularly seeks out news and information from those foolish or brave enough to venture into the Mournland. He has been known to fund expeditions into the blasted, wasted remains of his once-proud nation, hoping to discover some hint or clue that points to the cause of Cyre’s demise. In the meantime, Oargev works to improve the plight of his people and dreams of rebuilding Cyre—either in a restored Mournland or someplace else entirely.
