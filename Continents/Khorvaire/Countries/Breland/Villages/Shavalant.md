The center of Shavalant may be a single cobbled roadway and seven dusty cross-streets, but its wealth is defi nitely scattered across the surrounding 150 miles of gently rolling grasslands. Springing up around Tenneth Ford, the only easy crossing point along Shavalant Creek as it fl ows from the Ranruunwood to Silver Lake, Shavalant was the logical stopping point for ranchers bringing their stock to Orcbone or the trade road from Xandrar.

The stockyards of Shavalant are one of House Vadalisâ€™s key holdings. The dragonmarked house effectively rules the town, since its designated representative consistently wins election as village spokesperson.
