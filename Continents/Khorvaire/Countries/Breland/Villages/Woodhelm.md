[[Breland]]
1. **Type:** Village

Woodhelm is a village in north-central Breland in the middle of the Dragonwood at the banks of the Dagger River.

As its name suggests, the village's main industry is timber. The villagers cut lumber in the Dragonwood, lash the logs together, and ride them as rafts downriver to Galethspyre to be processed, carved, or milled.
