2. **Population:** 240

A small village in the county of Clarn chiefl y houses farmers who take advantage of the fi ne soil and weather along the southern edge of the Mistmarsh Swamp. The citizens of Mistmarsh enjoy an above-average standard of living, and many families have one or more daring youths who partake in the annual treks into the Faded Forest to gather the magical acorns that grow there. While dangerous, these expeditions are highly organized and well prepared, with each family keeping secret records of where particular dragonseye and ghost oaks can be found.

Alben irâ€™Clarn (LN male human aristocrat 1/ranger 2), the youngest son of [[Ruken ir'Clarn]], serves as sheriff in the region. He has been a friend to the people of the hamlet and is well respected, though they fear he does not pay enough attention to their warnings about the perils of the Mistmarsh Swamp.
