[[Breland]]
1. **Type:** Nature

These high, rugged mountains defi ne the western border of modern Breland. The Graywalls have been an important barrier in wars across Khorvaire for millennia, playing a part in containing the destruction of the Daelkyr War. Veins of rare byeshk and precious adamantine still lie hidden in the tall peaks. In addition to the slick, dangerous slopes, the Graywalls are home to numerous fl ying predators. Some adventurers come seeking these beasts, hoping to bring back a clutch of griffon eggs to sell or raise.

Like many areas of Breland, the Graywalls have an unusual number of manifest zones scattered among the peaks. Most are attuned to Risia and go unnoticed among the naturally occurring glaciers. The spectacularly active volcano Kobekâ€™s Voice almost certainly has a Fernia zone at its heart. Two such zones have been bound together to power an unusual eldritch engine built during the Last War.
