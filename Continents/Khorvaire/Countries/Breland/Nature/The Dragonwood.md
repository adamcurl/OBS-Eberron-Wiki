[[Breland]]
1. **Type:** Nature

The forest is filled with dense undergrowth, making most of it nigh-impassable. Deep in the forest stands an obelisk of pearl-gray stone and bearing no markings, called the Eruunstone. At its base, a spring emerges and gives rise into the Laughing River, which feeds two small, 0.5‑mile-wide (0.8‑kilometer) twin lakes. The water drains into a narrow gorge before leaving the forest and joining the Dagger. The riverbanks are steep, but not as thickly covered.

The village of [[Woodhelm]] lies in the forest's fringe, near the Dagger River. The villagers cut lumber in the Dragonwood, lash the logs together, and ride them as rafts downriver to Galethspyre to be processed, carved, or milled.

Nixies, mindless quori, and belligerent ragewalkers have been sighted along the banks of the rivers, making exploration dangerous.

In local legends, the twin lakes are called Glisten and Gloam and are said to bear the magic of dreams. Wishes made on the waters might come true, and spells like _wish_ and _miracle_ can be cast cheaper and easier. The legends go on to say that wishes made on one invariably come back to bite the wisher, while those made on the other don't come true as expected, but favor the wished in the end. However, from the legends it is uncertain which lake is which, so those who come here must pick one and hope for the best.
