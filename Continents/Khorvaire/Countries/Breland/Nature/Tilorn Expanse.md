1. **Type:** Nature

Stretching from the Dagger River to the Gray Rakes, this great plain was nearly untouched by the coming of Galifar. Since before the rise of the Dhakaani Empire, the region has had a reputation as haunted and treacherous. While enormous to begin with, the vast grassy plains sometimes seem to go on forever. Unlike most of southwestern Khorvaire, Tilorn has no great goblinoid ruins to serve as way markers, just the occasional low, nameless hill or green ridge in a sea of waist high grass. Armies and caravans have ventured onto the plains only to discover years have passed during their week-long excursion. Other times only their remains are found, with signs of starvation and wagon wheels worn down as if from many thousands of miles of use.
