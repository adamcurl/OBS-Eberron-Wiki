The Laughing River fl ows out of a spring at the base of an unmarked obelisk of pearl-gray stone deep in the Dragonwood. The water fl ows into a pair of small lakes, each roughly half a mile across, before draining into a narrow gorge and fl owing out of the forest, running all the way to the Hilt of the Dagger River. While much of the Dragonwood borders on impassable, the banks of the river are steep, but not covered with the dense undergrowth that fi lls much of the wood. The twin lakes are known as Glisten and Gloam in local folklore, and are charged with the magic of dreams. Wish, limited wish, miracle and similar spells have their XP costs reduced by 25% when cast from on the waters of either lake. Legends say that wishes (with or without use of the spell) made on one lake always turn back on the wisher, while those made on the other rarely take the expected form but usually turn out for the best. The tales do not clearly identify which lake is which, so those who journey there must decide where best to make their desires known. Beyond the promise and the dangers of the lakes, the presence of aggressive ragewalkers, mindless breeds of quori, and nixies along the riverâ€™s banks makes any expedition to the lakes hazardous at best.
