[[Breland]]
1. **Type:** Town

Starilaskur is a large Brelish city in northern Breland. It is a major lightning rail stop, providing a jumping off point for travelers coming to and from Zilargo, as well as being one of the final stops before Thrane. The city also lies at the juxtaposition of several Orien trade roads.

Starilaskur is also an Airship hub that routes to either Wroat or Korranberg.

On 15 Therendor, 916 YK, the city, in the hands of the Brelish, was attacked by a major Thrane assault. This was despite the fact that the assault occurred on the holiday known as Sun's Blessing, traditionally a day of peace where even armies cease fighting. As a result, many Brelish consider the attack to have been deeply dishonorable.
