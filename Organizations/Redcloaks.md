## Summary
The Redcloak Battalion is an elite unit that can be employed against major threats in Breland. When a situation calls for extreme military force, local law enforcement turns to the Redcloak Battalion. This elite unit fought at the forefront of the Last War, and the bards in Menthis still sing songs of the exploits of Khandan the Hammer and Meira the Huntress. At the end of the war, the battalion was split up into different cities out of fear that they would become too powerful.

Many of the members of the Redcloak Battalion resent being relegated to law enforcement, and there is a strong sense of rivalry between the Redcloaks and the King’s Swords of the Citadel, who generally have less military experience but nonetheless possess far more authority and prestige. As battle scarred veterans of the Last War, many of the soldiers have strong prejudices against travelers from the other nations; as far as the Redcloaks are concerned, the Treaty of Thronehold is merely an intermission, and soon King Boranel will come to his senses and fi nish the job Wroann ir’Wynarn began.

The typical Redcloak has 7 warrior levels and 2 levels of fi ghter, ranger, or barbarian. For magical support, the unit has three countermages—9th-level magewrights equipped with wands of dispel magic—and three 9th-level adepts. While a Redcloak is allowed some leeway his in choice of personal equipment, all members of the unit wear a hooded crimson cloak of resistance +1 while on duty. This bears two badges: the seal of the Brelish crown on the left collar, and the unit insignia—a snarling displacer beast surrounded by the words “First in Battle, Last to Fall”—on the right.

The Redcloaks are a highly trained military unit and use careful strategy when dealing with any crisis situation. They make use of magic items appropriate to the situation, such as a potion of resist energ y or protection from arrows. Redcloak countermages use prepared actions to dispel the attacks of enemy spellcasters, and the warriors target the most vulnerable opponents as quickly as possible. They use thunderstones and tanglefoot bags to disorient or handicap opponents. Even though they are only warriors and magewrights, a Redcloak squad should pose a serious threat to a PC party of equal level.
