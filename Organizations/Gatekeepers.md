## Summary
The Gatekeepers are the oldest of the many druid sects of Khorvaire, though they were heavily decimated during the invasions of the daelkyr. Their main task is to defend nature against aberrations, outsiders, undead, and similarly unnatural beings. They maintain ancient seals that hold long-forgotten evils at bay.

The first of the Gatekeepers, orcs, were taught their magic by the dragon [[Vvaraak]].
