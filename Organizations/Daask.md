#Crime
* **Established: **996 YK

## Summary
Formed by monstrous immigrants from Droaam, Daask has been building its power in the Khyber’s Gate and Malleon’s Gate districts of Sharn for the last decade. It is most infamous for its monstrous enforcers, but the organization also draws members from the destitute populace of Sharn—largely goblins and shifters, but also humans, dwarves, and any other humanoid who feels that the current system has failed them. Daask makes its money through acts of violence, from mugging to armed robbery to outright pillaging. The group has diversified in recent years, building an extortion racket—threatening violence if tribute isn’t paid—and entering into the drug trade, selling both dreamlily and a mysterious substance called dragon’s blood.

From the outside, Daask appears to be interested solely in fomenting violence and chaos. The monstrous nature of its members reinforces this impression; most people consider the members of Daask to be savage beasts. The truth is more complicated. The Droaamites who make up the core of Daask aren’t merely criminals; they are elite soldiers of Droaam working for Sora Katra, and part of an operation that is taking root in larger cities across Khorvaire. The seemingly random attacks by Daask are part of a larger plan that, if it succeeds, will eventually give Sora Katra a foothold in the heart of Khorvaire.

Over the last two years, the Daask cell in Sharn has been waging a slowly escalating war against the holdings of the Boromar Clan. The Boromars were surprised by the violence of these attacks and have suffered significant losses. Daask prefers guerrilla tactics, using only as many combatants as necessary to get a job done, never staying in one place too long, and quickly retreating back to their turf. Though the Boromars still control much of criminal activity in the middle and upper parts of Sharn, Daask is gaining ground in the lower level of the city and controls crime in the Cogs.

## Locations
- [[Sharn]]

## NPCs
### Sora Katra (leader)
The ultimate leader of Daask, but as one of the Daughters of Sora Kell, she remains in Droaam. The hag stays in contact with all of her main subordinates by magic and keeps a detailed ledger of the group’s activities.

### Cavallah
A disciplined female [oni](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/oni) and the current leader of the Daask cell in Sharn. She is the mastermind of the organization’s machinations against the Boromar Clan, a scholar obsessed with studying Sharn’s manifest zone, and a devoted servant of Sora Katra. The oni wears a hag eye (see [Hags](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/monsters-h#Hags) in the Monster Manual) that enables Sora Katra to both see and hear what occurs in her presence.

### Harash
A male [medusa](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/medusa), is Cavallah’s right hand. He is a specialist in diplomacy and intimidation whom Cavallah trusts to monitor the members of Daask and maintain morale.

### Ash
A female human priest of the Shadow. As the most powerful and beloved of Daask’s priests, she runs the Temple of the Six. Some worry that Ash plans to challenge Cavallah for leadership, which could cause a rift in the organization’s membership.

### Keshta
The [gnoll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gnoll) Keshta commands a small unit of elite gnoll commandos. Disciplined and ruthless, these soldiers are often called upon to carry out retaliatory strikes against those who defy Daask.

### Zaeran
An elf [werewolf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/werewolf), is a recent arrival to Sharn. He’s one of the sons of the Droaamish warlord Zaeurl. Zaeran has come to the city with a small group of wererats and werewolves, and has an agenda known only to himself and Sora Katra.
