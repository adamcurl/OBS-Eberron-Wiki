## Summary
In the dawn of Sharn, there were three wizard’s circles: The Esoteric Order of Aureon, the Guild of Starlight and Shadows, and the Closed Circle. The wizards of the Closed Circle were interested in the lore of the daelkyr, and soon developed strong ties to the Cults of the Dragon Below. Eventually their work began to frighten the other two circles; it came to a war of wizards, and the Closed Circle was sealed in its fortress in the undercity. Now, centuries later, the Dragon Below has returned to this arcane fortress. A mind flayer named [[Chyrassk]] has emerged from Khyber and broken the seals of this ancient dungeon. Chyrassk brought a small force from Khyber—3 dolgaunts, 20 dolgrims, and 1 umber hulk—but he has begun to build up a human following, especially among the refugees of Cyre. He has found many disturbing and powerful relics in this fortress.
