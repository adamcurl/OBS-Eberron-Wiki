## Summary
There is one dark stain in the shared history of the arcane orders. Three hundred years ago, a third order arose in Sharn—a sinister cabal called the Closed Circle. This order specialized in transmutation and necromancy and dabbled in the forbidden lore of the daelkyr and the Dragon Below. It’s said that the members of the Closed Circle went mad and sought to summon terrible things; whatever the truth, the guild was wiped out more than two hundred years ago by the combined action of the Church of the Silver Flame, the Esoteric Order, and the Guild of Starlight and Shadows. Hidden workshops of the Closed Circle might still be found in Sharn, where vengeful liches or other wizards of the Circle practice their dark arts in hiding.

In the dawn of Sharn, there were three wizard’s circles: The Esoteric Order of Aureon, the Guild of Starlight and Shadows, and the Closed Circle. The wizards of the Closed Circle were interested in the lore of the daelkyr, and soon developed strong ties to the Cults of the Dragon Below. Eventually their work began to frighten the other two circles; it came to a war of wizards, and the Closed Circle was sealed in its fortress in the undercity. Now, centuries later, the Dragon Below has returned to this arcane fortress. A mind flayer named [[Chyrassk]] has emerged from Khyber and broken the seals of this ancient dungeon. Chyrassk brought a small force from Khyber—3 dolgaunts, 20 dolgrims, and 1 umber hulk—but he has begun to build up a human following, especially among the refugees of Cyre. He has found many disturbing and powerful relics in this fortress.
