## Summary
The Dark Lanterns serve the crown of Breland as spies and assassins. Collectively they form the intelligence division of the King’s Citadel, a much larger organization sworn to defend Breland from its enemies and dispense justice in the name of King Boranel. More than any other division within the Citadel, the Dark Lanterns tend toward intelligence-gathering missions that extend beyond Breland’s borders. As the secret servants of the crown, members of the organization are granted the authority to conduct intelligence operations on foreign soil, execute covert missions across the globe, and prevent national secrets from falling into the hands of rival intelligence agencies. The Dark Lanterns also have an unwritten license to eliminate any creature that threatens their nation, its sovereign, or its citizens.

The King’s Dark Lanterns were vital to Breland’s defense during the Last War. However, conspiracies abound in the aftermath of war as nations struggle to rebuild and reclaim what was lost. The Thronehold Accords have done nothing to end the secret confl icts being waged across the Five Nations—confl icts steeped in espionage and subterfuge. With the threat of another war looming on the horizon, Breland needs its Dark Lanterns now more than ever.

The organization has upward of 500 agents operating within Breland’s borders and roughly one-fi fth that number stationed abroad. Dark Lanterns often work in teams. They also work closely with other divisions of the King’s Citadel, including the King’s Wands and the King’s Swords. In addition, some Dark Lanterns join forces with adventurers whose goals happen to coincide with theirs; in such cases, they might choose to keep their allegiance to the crown of Breland a secret.

The common citizens of Breland respect and fear the King’s Dark Lanterns. They understand the purpose of the organization but sometimes call into question its methods, particularly when it turns its sharp eyes inward and begins spying on Breland nationals and resident foreigners. Although the Last War is over, most educated Brelish suspect that the Dark Lanterns still engage in acts of espionage and violence across Khorvaire, and they fear that one misstep could destroy the delicate peace set forth by the Treaty of Thronehold. Meanwhile, Brelish youth searching for adventure, intrigue, and the chance to explore exotic places dream of becoming Dark Lanterns when they grow up.

## Features

## Work
A Dark Lantern doesn’t make a lot of money and is expected to live a modest life, so as not to attract undue attention. The work he is called upon to perform can be as simple and straightforward as spying on a foreign diplomat for a few days or as dangerous and complex as buying information from a dubious source in a remote city while dodging rival agents and assassins. When not performing a service for the crown, a Dark Lantern can participate in private ventures, provided they don’t confl ict with his allegiance to the Brelish crown.
