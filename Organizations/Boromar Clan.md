#Crime

## Summary
The most powerful criminal organization in Sharn started as a family of halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains. Operating out of its headquarters and key holdings in the Little Plains district of Middle Menthis, the Boromar Clan controls gambling, smuggling, and theft in Sharn. Most of the city’s burglars, pickpockets, and fences either work for or pay tithes to the organization. The Boromar Clan’s network of extortion, bribery, and blackmail extends from Lower Dura to Skyway.

The Boromars’ influence extends beyond criminal enterprises into many legitimate circles of power. Ilyra Boromar sits on the city council, and a number of other councilors are close allies of the clan. The family has ties by marriage to House Jorasco. A Boromar attends every Skyway party. The family owns tenements throughout Sharn and invests in shipping, storing both legal goods and contraband in many of the warehouses in Precarious and Cogsgate. In many districts, local officials and Sharn Watch officers have been taking bribes from the Boromars for generations.

The criminal nature of the Boromar Clan is an open secret, and in some districts the Boromars are seen as hometown heroes. They are immigrants who’ve made good, common people who’ve risen to rival the barons and kings. They give the people what they want, whether it’s untaxed gambling, cheap spirits, or dreamlily. The clan operates with a degree of impunity because its operatives adhere to an unspoken rule: whenever possible, criminal acts against individuals should target tourists and travelers. Boromar pickpockets don’t prey on the people they see every day. Instead, they seek out the many strangers who move around the city all the time. The Watch officer who turns a blind eye to a pickpocket thus feels justified, since it’s not the citizens of Sharn that are victimized.

Boromar’s longstanding status at the head of Sharn’s criminal enterprises has recently come under challenge. After nearly a decade of slow growth, the Droaamish mob known as Daask has recently started targeting Boromar holdings. The halfling clan hasn’t faced such a serious threat before, and it’s scrambling to figure out how to deal with Daask’s guerrilla tactics.

## Locations
- [[Sharn]]

## NPCs
### Saidan Boromar (leader)
The current patriarch of the family. He grew up in Lower Dura and worked as a thief and assassin there before taking over the organization.

### Mala Boromar Jorasco (leader's wife)
An heir of House Jorasco and the Boromar family matriarch. Her position in the family ensures that important members of the Boromar Clan receive Jorasco healing services at no cost to them; Saidan reimburses Jorasco from the clan’s treasury.

### [[Councilor Ilyra Boromar]]
The eldest daughter of Mala and Saidan and a member of the city council. The Boromars’ enemies on the council have grown bolder in the face of increased Daask attacks against the clan, and some of Ilyra’s influence has eroded as a result.

### Halak Boromar
The family’s chief enforcer. A recent immigrant from the Talenta Plains, Halak leads the Clawfoots, the Boromars’ personal guard, and is an accomplished warrior.

### Ilsa Boromar
The family’s leader in Callestan. She is ruthless in protecting her family’s interests.

### Castar
A gnome, is the lone non-halfling in the Boromars’ inner circle. He serves as Saidan’s chief advisor and the organization’s intelligence expert. The family looks to Castar to come up with a plan to defeat Daask, but so far none of his ideas have worked.
