## Summary
Long ago, the dragonmarked houses sought to exterminate the bearers of aberrant dragonmarks. Today, those who carry aberrant dragonmarks are still treated with fear and suspicion. During the Last War, the King’s Dark Lanterns of Breland trained a team of covert operatives who all bore aberrant marks. Considered expendable, this group was sent on one suicide mission after another. After half its members died in the field, the survivors turned on their masters. Six years ago, they fled to Sharn and founded House Tarkanan. The group takes its name from Lord Halas Tarkanan, who fought the dragonmarked houses long ago and used his aberrant dragonmark to destroy Old Sharn.

The smallest of the four criminal organizations in Sharn, House Tarkanan has no interest in claiming territory or dominating the criminal underworld. The house takes neither side in the war between the Boromar Clan and Daask, and it will not assassinate high-ranking members of either organization. In other matters, it sells its services to all who have the gold to pay for them. House Tarkanan’s top priority is using its wealth to protect, train, and care for people who have aberrant marks. The leaders of the house are pragmatists and soldiers, and they train their recruits to be warriors and thieves.

Despite its name, House Tarkanan is not a dragonmarked house; it has taken the name to mock its enemies, and it doesn’t have the recognition, power, or resources of a dragonmarked house. In fact, many members of House Tarkanan hate the dragonmarked houses for being prejudiced against their kind and fear that they will instigate a second purge of aberrant marks. Others are more idealistic, and see the growing power of the houses as a threat to all of the nations of Khorvaire.

- Assassination of the soul
	- For twice the usual fee, a House Tarkanan assassin will kill her target using a +1 Keeper’s fang dagger—trapping the victim’s soul in the domain of the Keeper and thus preventing her from being raised or resurrected. Of course, resurrection is rare enough on Eberron that mutilating the body is often suffi cient to rule out raise dead.
