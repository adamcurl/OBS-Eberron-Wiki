## Summary
A bard is a versatile individual, equally skilled at entertainment and espionage. These talents are perfectly matched to the city of Sharn, which is both the cultural heart of Breland and a nexus for intrigue and diplomacy. Bards have much to gain from the company of other bards, as they exchange news, stories, and songs. For this purpose, long ago a group of the finest bards in Sharn founded the Circle of Song, an alliance of entertainers and adventurers.

The Circle of Song is an informal organization, open to any bard who knows its customs and who can find an outpost. It has no membership dues; you’re expected to make a donation if you make significant use of the group’s resources.

## Perks
- You can always find food and lodging at a circle outpost, though you might be expected to entertain the patrons in exchange. If times are tough, your food and lodging might be a step lower than the usual quality of the inn, but at least it’s free.
- You have advantage on ability checks made to perform research or gather information while in a circle outpost, provided you have an opportunity to peruse archives and talk with other members.
- Circle members are often willing to do minor favors for other members—gathering information, embarrassing a minor noble, causing a distraction. There’s no cost for such a service, but anyone who helps you will expect you to provide similar assistance when they need it.
