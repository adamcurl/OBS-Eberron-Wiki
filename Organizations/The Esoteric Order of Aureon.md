## Summary
The guildhall of one of Sharn’s most prestigious arcane orders. A reliable source for arcane spellcasting services.

The larger of Sharn’s wizard circles, the Esoteric Order of Aureon has its headquarters in Clifftop. The Order’s tower is built of white marble, and glamers have been woven into the stone that cause the tower to shimmer and glow so that it seems as if it has been crafted of solid light.

Not all members of the Order sell their services, but if a party seeks an arcane spellcaster in Clifftop, this is the place to visit. Generally, spells of up to 3rd level can be obtained at standard prices, and 4th-level spells may be available. However, the wizards of the Order may not have the spell a party seeks prepared; in such cases, a client must wait 24 hours to complete their purchase.
