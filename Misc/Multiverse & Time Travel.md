Although the universe of Eberron is cut off from the multiverse, travel between universes is possible. However, it is extremely difficult, dangerous, and rooted in theory.

The root of this theory lies in the Progenitor Dragons' creation of Eberron. When Siberys was destroyed and Eberron consumed Khyber, the Ring of Siberys was created to keep the universe protected from meddling gods, celestials, and fiends from other universes. So, the Ring of Siberys is what protects Eberron from other universes and prevents multiverse travel from within Eberron.

The Ring of Siberys is so massive and so strong, that many are unsure if it can even be damaged. Perhaps something as powerful as the Mourning, focused on the ring, could manage to break a section of it. Siberys shards do fall from the Ring, but it shows no sign of dwindling. This leaves a few options...

## Breaking the Ring
If a powerful attack is focused on the Ring of Siberys, or if the ring weakens over time, then multiversal travel could be possible, but the portals out of the crystal sphere would be very few and small.

## Xoriat and the Maze of Reality
Oddly, the most valid form of multiversal travel would be through the plane of [[Xoriat]]. If the maze allows one to travel back in time, then it is theoretically possible to jump into the maze, travel back to the very beginning of creation, and jump out right before the Progenitor Dragons created the universe. Since the Ring of Siberys hasn't been formed yet, there is no barrier.

However, finding a portal out of the crystal sphere could be extremely unpredictable, if not impossible, since one would be traveling in a swirl of everything and nothing before the universe was even created. 

Traveling back into the universe of Eberron would have to happen and the beginning of the universe or in the future when the Ring is weakened.
