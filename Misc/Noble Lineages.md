## Galifar
King Galifar I united the five nations of Khorvaire under on crown and established the Kingdom of Galifar, which lasted for almost 900 years.

When king Jarot died, the crown should have passed to Princess Mishann of Cyre, his eldest daughter. Instead, Prince Thalin, Prince Kaius, and Princess Wroann rejected the appointment of their older sister. Though Prince Wrogar, King Jarot's fourth child and governor-prince of the nation of Aundair supported his sister, it was not enough and soon the Five Nations used the armies King Jarot had amassed along with the new technologies to wage war against one another. This bloody conflict became known as the Last War, thanks in part to the Korranberg Chronicle.

In 894 YK, when the Kingdom of Galifar collapsed and each scion declared his or her nation to be a sovereign and independent country.
