*This drug is magical. Its positive effects do not take hold in an antimagic field, but the negative aspects of the drug’s secondary effects and addiction remain.

**Absentia requires a Will save rather than a Fortitude save.

***Cost 10gp if obtained legally

### Absentia
This unusual drug first appeared in Sharn at the end of the Last War, and while it has little practical value it has developed a following among the jaded rich. Use of absentia is illegal in Sharn. The potion is produced in Riedra by the Inspired and sold in Sharn by the Boromar clan. In addition to the Alchemy skill, the creator of absentia must have access to the remote viewing psionic power.

**Initial Effect:** The user falls into a comatose state for one hour. During the coma, the character perceives the world through the senses of another. This is similar to scrying, but it is concentrated on an individual, and the user perceives sensations through all five senses. The target is selected randomly and could be anyone within a radius of one mile from the user, though the potion cannot affect anyone protected by mind blank or a similar effect.

**Secondary Effect:** None.

**Side Effects:** During the coma induced by absentia, a Quori spirit can possess the user’s body regardless of the Charisma score of the victim or his willingness to be possessed. However, this is a carefully guarded secret, and not something the Quori use frequently; most people believe that somnambulism is a side effect of the drug.

**Overdose:** None

### Dragon's Blood
This dark fluid is not literally dragon’s blood; it derives its name from its power to enhance the innate magical abilities of sorcerers and dragonmarks. The nature of the drug is a mystery. It is produced by the hags of Droaam and uses a component that has yet to be identifi ed; without this component, it is impossible to create.

Dragon’s blood is an addictive drug that can be quite dangerous to the user. It is illegal in Sharn, but the monsters of Daask still sell it in the shadow markets of the Cogs. For many sorcerers and dragonmarked heirs, the power of the blood is worth the risk of venturing into these lawless areas.

A character can only gain the benefi ts of one elixir of dragon’s blood per day, regardless of the specifi c type of blood. After it is used, subsequent doses have no effect until 24 hours have passed. If a character is addicted to dragon’s blood, only make checks for the type of blood with the highest addiction save DC. He can avoid an addiction check by drinking any color of dragon’s blood.

Note that any use of dragon’s blood can potentially lead to an overdose, provided the user fails a Will save. For purposes of dragon’s blood, aberrant dragonmarks are considered to be least dragonmarks.

One of the weaker varieties of dragon’s blood, black dragon’s blood enhances spells and dragonmark abilities with metamagic-like effects.

**Initial Effect:** The next use of a dragonmark or a sorcerer spell of 2nd level or lower is enhanced with the effects of Enlarge Spell and Extend Spell. This effect lasts for ten minutes or until the user casts a spell or uses a dragonmark.

**Secondary Effect:** 1d6 points of psychic damage. 

**Side Effects:** DC 16 Con save or the user is under the effect of Wild Surge

**Overdose:** DC 14 Wisdom save or take 2d6 points of damage.

### Dreamlily
Healers first used essence of dreamlily, a powerful opiate from Sarlona, during the Last War. Though dreamlily isn’t illegal if used for medicinal purposes, it’s heavily taxed, and thus most dreamlily is smuggled in and sold on the black market. Dreamlily dens can be found across the lower wards. Consuming dreamlily causes disorienting euphoria and brings about remarkable resistance to pain.

Essence of dreamlily is an iridescent, psionically active liquid. It draws on the mind of the user, and tastes like his favorite beverage. Each use of the drug can potentially lead to an overdose, especially for those addicted to it.

**Initial Effect:** A creature under the effects of dreamlily is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it drops to 0 hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Secondary Effect:** 1d4 points of psychic damage.

**Side Effects:** User can take only a single action each round while under the influence of dreamlily.

**Overdose:** DC 10 Will save or take 2d4 points of damage.

**Special:** A dreamlily addict takes a –2 penalty on all Wisdom saving throws. This effect lasts until he manages to break the addiction.

## Addictions
| Rating     | Con DC | Satiation | Damage                    |
| ---------- | ------ | --------- | ------------------------- |
| Negligible | 5      | 1 day     | 1d4 - 2 Dex               |
| Low        | 10     | 10 days   | 1d4 Dex                   |
| Medium     | 14     | 5 days    | 1d4 Dex, 1d4 Wis          |
| High       | 16     | 2 days    | 1d6 Dex, 1d6 Wis, 1d4 Con |
| Extreme    | 20     | 1 day     | 1d6 Dex, 1d6 Wix, 1d6 Con | 

**Addiction:** Drugs are rated according to their addictive potential. Drugs increase their rating by one step for every two full months a character remains addicted to the drug. A character who recovers from an addiction and later becomes readdicted does so at the addiction rating the drug had just prior to his recovery.

**Satiation:** Each time the user takes the drug to which he is addicted, he is satiated and staves off withdrawal symptoms for the given period of time. After the satiation period wears off, the DC of the Constitution save to resist the effects of addiction increases by +5. The dose in which a character becomes addicted counts for satiation.

**Damage:** Addiction deals the listed damage each day unless the character succeeds at a Constitution saving throw or is satiated.

**Recovery:** If a character makes two successful saving throws in a row, he has fought off his addiction and recovers, taking no more damage. Of course, he can always become addicted again by taking another dose of the drug and failing his Constitution save to resist addiction.

A *lesser restoration* or *restoration* spell may negate some or all of the ability score damage caused by an addiction, but on the next day the victim accrues more ability score damage if he continues to fail his Constitution saves. *Remove disease* immediately causes the user to recover from the addiction, but it does not restore lost ability score points. *Greater restoration* or *heal* causes recovery and restores all ability score damage from the addiction.
