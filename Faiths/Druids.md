The Ashbound defend the natural world from anything that threatens it. Some Ashbound consider civilization to be a threat and strike at any settlement that encroaches on the wild. Others focus their wrath on the dragonmarked houses or seek to free bound elementals.

## [[Children of Winter]]
The Children of Winter believe that death and decay are vital aspects of the natural cycle of life. They believe that if the cycle falls out of balance, it will trigger a devastating cataclysm as the world resets this balance. They battle undead, but they also engage in actions that cull the weak. Extremists have been known to spread plagues in cities. The Children of Winter are particularly interested in unraveling the mystery of the Mourning, as some of them believe it is a sign of the apocalypse they fear.

The Gatekeepers maintain ancient seals that hold long-forgotten evils at bay.
