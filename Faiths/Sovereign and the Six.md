## Deities

* **Arawai**

    * The Sovereign of Life and Love. She is the patron of fertility and of the benevolent aspects of nature, bringing good harvest and gentle rain.

* **Aureon**

    * The Sovereign of Law and Lore. He is considered the first wizard, who shared the secrets of wizardry with the world.

* **Balinor**


    * The Sovereign of Horn and Hunt. He guides both the beast and the hunter, and he is the patron of those who walk on the edge of civilization and the natural world.

* **Boldrei**

    * The Sovereign of Hall and Hearth. She guides and protects communities and families, inspiring people to work together for the common good.

* **Dol Arrah**

    * The sun that drives away the darkness. She stands for wisdom in war and for those who fight with honor, pursue justice, and make sacrifices for the greater good.

* **Dol Dorn**

    * The Sovereign of Strength and Steel. He is the patron of the common soldier, and he guides the hands of anyone who holds a weapon. He embodies courage, strength, and martial skill.

* **Kol Korran**

    * The Sovereign of World and Wealth. He guards travelers and guides traders. Although the Trickery domain is suggested for his clerics, Kol Korran guides fair negotiation; those driven solely by greed prefer the Keeper of the Dark Six.

## Anti-Deities

^7c0522


* **The Devourer**

    * Governs the destructive power of nature, both pure elemental force and savagery in beasts.


* **The Keeper**

    * Snatches souls before they can reach Dolurrh and hoards them along with his vast wealth. Those driven by greed call him their patron, and his priests often act as criminal fixers.

* **The Fury**

    * Governs both passion and revenge, rage and despair. She offers revenge to those who have been wronged, but her vengeance often leads to suffering.

* **The Mockery**

    * The patron of treachery and of terror in battle. He guides those who seek victory through guile, both warriors and assassins. He was once the brother of Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah, but he was stripped of his skin and his name after betraying them.

* **The Shadow**

    * The dark side of knowledge and ambition. It’s said to be Aureon’s shadow, given malign life when Aureon mastered magic. The Shadow is the maker of monsters and the keeper of forbidden secrets, and it offers malevolent spells to warlocks and wizards.

* **The Traveler**

    * Asserts that chaos drives evolution and that change makes us stronger. The Traveler is a trickster and the giver of dangerous gifts. Some artificers worship the Traveler, seeing it as the lord of innovation, but the gifts of the Traveler always have unexpected consequences.


## Saints

* **The Silver Flame**

    * Considered to be a cage created by the Sovereigns to contain the overlords.


## Subsects

* **The Pyrinean Creed**

    * The dominant sect in the Five Nations and the source of the Octagram, division of the Nine and Six, and holidays. The Pyrinean Creed’s views differ on whether or not the Sovereigns were dragons, ancient warriors, or celestials.
    * Pyrine was a Sarlonan nation that codified the Sovereign Host. However, Pyrine is now assimilated into Sarlona and no longer worships the Sovereign Host.

* **The Church of the Wyrm Ascendant**

    * Worships the Sovereigns like the Pyrinean Creed, except they assert that the Sovereigns were dragons. The church is very focused on wealth and economic power; members are expected to contribute to the hoard of their local temple, and the priests often engage in behavior that outsiders might consider to be corrupt.
    * They believe that mortals can ascend to become the Sovereigns themselves.
        * Popular rumor holds that the founder of the Library of Korranberg, Dorius Alyre ir’Korran, built the library as part of a quest to assume the mantle of Aureon
    * They believe the dragons themselves are divine tools and emissaries of the Sovereigns and Six, though few dragons have ever acknowledged the church in any way. It’s thought that the dragons themselves follow a form of this faith known as Thir—Draconic for “three”—but the traditions of Argonnessen are rarely revealed to people of Khorvaire.
    * This sect is the strongest in Aundair and Zilargo with noteworthy temples in Stormreach, Korranberg, and Fairhaven.


* **The Restful Watch**

    * This sect specializes in embalming, funerals, and cemetery maintenance. They can be found in every major city in the Five Nations, and even smaller towns may have a devotee of the Watch tending the boneyard.
    * The Restful Watch maintains that the souls of the dead pass through Dolurrh into the realm of the Sovereigns—unless they are snatched by the Keeper’s greedy talons. They also give advice on what ornaments and sacrifices to give to the deceased (the greater the person was, the greater the sacrifice).
    * The Restful Watch believes that if Aureon knows that a dead hero will be needed in the future, he has the Keeper snatch the soul before it reaches Dolurrh, so it can be restored when the time is right. Thus, while the Restful Watch primarily reveres Aureon, they also understand and respect the Keeper, and believe that he serves a vital purpose.


* **The Three Faces cults**

    * The Three Faces cults honor particular groupings of the Sovereigns and Six, asserting that there are members of the Six with something valuable to offer worshippers. Beyond this, the cults are also secret societies—a form of fraternal order that binds people together even if they aren’t truly invested in the religious aspects of the cult
    * **The Three Faces of Coin** honors Kol Korran, Onatar, and Kol Turrant (the Keeper). This cult operates in major cities, usually recruiting merchants, smugglers, and captains of industry. It is based on the idea that while honest trade and industry form the core of commerce, there should always be a way for people to get what they desire; thus, it is a neutral ground where criminals and guild artisans can work together.
    * **The Three Faces of Love** honors Boldrei, Arawai, and Szorawai (the Fury)—the Love that Binds, the Love that Brings Life, and the Love that Burns. This cult embraces all who believe in and wield the power of love, from actors to poets to paid companions. Members gather to share stories and change lives; the cult excels at matchmaking and at disrupting important relationships they consider to be doomed.
    * **The Three Faces of War** honors Dol Arrah, Dol Dorn, and Dol Azur (the Mockery). It was part of the united armies of Galifar, and cult chapters can be found in all of the armies of the Five Nations. Sect meetings provide a place for soldiers and veterans to interact as friends and equals, regardless of rank or nationality. The cult asserts that honor and courage are to be valued, but there is also a time and place for cunning and cruelty, even if it is never to be desired.
    * **The Three Faces of the Wild** honors Arawai, Balinor, and Shargon (the Devourer). Sects are usually found in rural communities, and include farmers, hunters, and all manner of wanderers. The Three Faces of the Wild supports agriculture and hunting, but recognizes that the wild cannot be fully tamed. Members sometimes engage in ritual sacrifices or the burning of fields or other acts of destruction. They believe that the Devourer must have his due—and by making their chosen offerings, they keep him from striking elsewhere.
