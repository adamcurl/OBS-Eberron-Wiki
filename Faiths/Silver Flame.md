## Celestial Deities

*   **The Silver Flame**

    * A force of absolute good that seeks to abolish evil and protect the innocent
    * Created when the couatl bound Bel Shalor


## Anti-Deities

* **Shadow in the Flame (Bel Shalor)**

    * Overlord of corruption and shadows
    * Bound by the couatl to form the Silver Flame during the Age of Demons
    * Was temporarily released in 299 YK and claimed dominion over Thrane before Tira Maron sacrificed herself to bind him again.
    * Bel Shalor continuously tries to corrupt followers of the Silver Flame in order to weaken his prison
    * Bel Shalor’s prakhutu is a radshasa Durastoran the Wyrmbreaker


## Saints

* **Tira Maron** (Voice of the Silver Flame) // Human female

    * The liaison for the Silver Flame
    * Was a paladin of Dol Arrah and served the Silver Flame for a year after a couatl warned her of a fire that would spread across Thrane
    * In 299 YK, she sacrificed herself along with some other couatl and her sword Kloinjer to bind Bel Shalor again, which produced a cool and silver divine flame that began the Church of the Silver Flame
    * Kloinjer is now thrusted to the hilt at the spot where the Silver Flame emerges


## Anti-Saints

* **Melysse Miron** (Anti-Keeper) // Human female

    * She challenged the Keeper of the Flame (Kyra Danth) in 497 YK, saying that she was the descendant of Tira and thus the rightful Keeper. This led to the Time of Two Keepers
    * Melysse challenged many church doctrines, saying the church had strayed and performed many miracles that caused a deep schism in the church.
    * Melysse was eventually revealed to be the hand of Bel Shalor. Out of fear her death would allow Bel Shalor to choose another successor, she was petrified and locked away in Dreadhold, where she remains today.


## Subsects

* **Miron’s Tears**

    * A secret order of spies and assassins hidden even from the Keeper and Cardinals.
    * According to legend, Tira Miron foresaw the danger of the Shadow in the Flame and appointed her trusted companion Samyr Kes (Elf male) to look over the church and eliminate any threats to it.



* **Pure Flame**

    * An extremist sect that seeks to eliminate every lycanthrope and “innately evil” monster, such as trolls, harpies, and ogres. They have a harsh and uncompassionate view of evil and show no mercy to those that are evil. They are intolerant, bigoted, and violent. To them, all evil is equal and deserves harsh punishment.


* **Ghaash’kala** ^5c99a0

    * A sect that predates the Church of the Silver Flame and humanity. The Ghaash’kala are mostly comprised of orcs, but other races can join. They worship the Binding Flame by keeping fiends and barbarians in the Demon Wastes. They view it as their duty to protect the rest of Khorvaire from these threats.


* **Serpent Cults** ^8de871

    * The Serpent Cults honor the countless couatls that sacrificed themselves to create the Silver Flame. They are the oldest and most unknown sect of the Silver Flame. Instead of listening to the Voice or a Keeper, they listen to the voice of couatls that did not sacrifice themselves, but instead lived on to guide others.


* **Whispering Flame**

    * A cult of the Dragon Below that exists within the Church of the Silver Flame
