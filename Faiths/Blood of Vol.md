#Faith
[[Eberron]]
## Deities

*   **None/Self.** 
    *   The religion focuses on the “Divinity Within” that all creatures can unlock, and thus beat the mundane and cruel fate of the afterlife and ascend to godhood. To Seekers’ eyes, life is suffering, and we must persevere to ascend past it.


## Anti-Deities

*   **The Sovereign Hosts**
    *   Seekers do not directly oppose or believe the Sovereign are evil, but they do believe they are cruel and unjust.


## Saints


*   **The line of Vol**
    *   The elves who had the Mark of Death and toyed with necromancy to unlock their full power. After the line was wiped out and their supporters exiled to Khorvaire, the exiled elves started to spread word of this line of Vol wanted to transcend mortality, only to be punished by the cruel gods. Most Seekers do not know of the line of Vol or even Erandis Vol, but this is the origin of the faith. Ironically, the line of Vol and Erandis never wanted to unlock this “divinity within”, but only to utilize their mark to the fullest extent.


*   **“Vol”**
    *   Seekers believe in a person named Vol that was the first to find the divinity within and challenge the curse of mortality who was destroyed by the jealous Sovereigns. This person never existed, but could be based off of Erandis Vol


## Subsects


*   **The Seekers of the Divinity Within**
    *   The most common and widespread path of the religion. Seekers do not have a formal church structure and usually keep their worship to themselves. These Seekers come to their local abactor (the high priest in a community) for advice. These separated communities are united by a grid of larger temples across Khorvaire. Each separate community has their own traditions and beliefs, so heresy is not a main concern.
    *   The Seekers value community, family, and camaraderie. They seek to unlock the divinity within and challenge their own mortality.
    *   The only exception to these smaller, connected communities is the Karrnath city of Atur, the City of Night, which is the most public bastion dedicated to the fatih. The mummy lord Hass Malevanor is the head priest in this city supported by a rumored group of undead warriors known as the Crimson Covenant.


*   **The Bloodsails**
    *   The elves of the Bloodsail Principality occupy the island of Farlnen in the Lhazaar Principalities. These elves are direct descendants of the supporters of Vol and believe in the same history as the Seekers, but they don’t seek the divinity within. Instead, they actively seek immortality through undeath. On the island, vampires must earn their afterlife by paying velgys, or blood money, to the lords of the land. Those who can’t have their souls bound to objects, usually ships to help steer and control them after death. Bloodsail elves often bear crimson tattoos that are tied to their families and vessels.



*   **The Order of the Emerald Claw**
    *   The Order of the Emerald Claw is an extremist sect comprised of angry Karrnathi patriots and Seeker extremists that serve the Queen of the Dead, who the inner circle knows as Lady Illmarrow of Farlen, who states that her actions are for the good of Karrnath and the Blood of Vol, but really only benefit her and her goals. ^88bbfb


*   **Thieves of Life**
    *   The Thieves of Life are hermits that are determined to unlock their divinity within at and immortality any cost. They practice necromancy on others, while not becoming undead themselves.

* **The Stillborn**
