#Faith
[[Eberron]]

Thir is the name for the religion followed by most dragons. The name of the faith is the draconic word for "three", referring to the three Progenitor Dragons, the three steps in time, past, present, and future, and the three levels of divinity: the Progenitors, the dragon gods, and the Sovereigns.

## Deities

### Progenitor Dragons
Adherents to this religion believe that the Progenitor Dragons, Eberron, Siberys, and Khyber, were the forces responsible for the world's creation and its inhabitants, and the Draconic Prophecy's existence in the world is a reflection of the Progenitor's Dragon's plans for creation. However, while the Progenitors are powerful beings deserving of respect, Siberys is dead, and Eberron and Khyber are too powerful and great to hear prayers and worship. Instead most dragons venerate the dragon gods.

### Dragon Gods
Each god is represented by a constellation in the sky, and the gods are believed to reside in a place of existence beyond Eberron's standard planes, with the exception of Tiamat, who is imprisoned in Khyber. The dragon gods are only concerned with dragons, and lesser creatures such as humans and elves are the purview of Sovereigns.

#### Io
Io is the draconic god of magic and knowledge.

#### Aasterinian
Aasterinian is the draconic god of invention and trade.

#### Astilabor
Astilabor is the draconic god of wealth.

#### Bahamut
Bahamut is the draconic god of protection and good fortune.

#### Chronepsis
Chronepsis is the draconic god of fate and prophecy.

#### Falazure
Falazure is the draconic god of death and decay.

#### Garyx
Garyx is the draconic god of chaos and destruction.

#### Hlal
Hlal is the draconic god of humor.

#### Lendys
Lendys is the draconic god of justice and law.

#### Tamara
Tamara is the draconic god of life.

#### Tiamat
Tiamat is the draconic god of greed and power, as well as an Overlord bound in Khyber.

Also known as the Daughter of Khyber, Tiamat embodies the evil that lurks in the heart of every dragon and she has the power to corrupt dragons. Chromatic dragons are especially vunerable to her wiles, but any dragon can fall prey to her manipulation. During the Age of Demons, Tiamat was bound below Argonnessen.

Tiamat has no exarch on the Council of Ashtakala; her cult - known as the Talons of Tiamat - works independently of the Lords of Dust.

She stirs in the Pit of Five Sorrows where she rouses the dark emotions in the hearts of dragonkind.

### The Sovereigns
The Sovereigns in Thir belief generally corresponds to the fifteen members Sovereign Host and the Dark Six. The first Sovereigns were believed to be dragons of great or ill renown who ascended to godhood during the Age of Demons.

Followers of Thir believe that a dragon who comes to embody a fundamental concept in life will ascend to replace one of the Sovereigns in death, allowing the replaced Sovereign to ascend to the home of the dragon gods.

Believers of Thir also teach that this cyclical replacement and ascension of the Sovereigns also applies to the higher forms of divinity. Once the Draconic Prophecy has run its course, three new progenitors will be chosen from among the dragon gods, and the Sovereigns of this reality will become the dragon gods of the next reality.

## Holy Sites
There are several locations in Argonnessen that followers of Thir consider holy sites.

### Valley of the Three
The primary shrine of Thir is the Valley of the Three in the western region of The Thousand, where great idols of the draconic gods are arranged in a circle. The holy site is the primary place of worship for dragon priests of the Thousand, and many followers of Thir will make a pilgrimage to the site.

### The Face of Eberron
Another holy site is the Face of Eberron, a massive stone dragon head three miles in length, on the southern shores of Argonnessen. The Face of Eberron is believed by the priests of Thir to be the head of Eberron herself, and is a gathering place for druids who follow Eberron.
