## 	The Vigilant Eye

*   **Power: **Belashyrra
*   **Structure: **Corrupted
*   Cult members develop an alien eye on the palm of their non-dominant hand. When they view the world through this eye, members can see “secrets” about the world around them that feel true—such as seeing certain people are possessed by demons or about to commit murder. Members take vigilante action to eliminate the threats “revealed” by their eyes. This cult often takes root in [[Deneith|House Deneith]] enclaves or city watch units.


## 	Whisperers

*   **Power: **Kyrzin
*   **Structure: **Traditional
*   An ancient tradition found across the [[Shadow Marches]]. Whisperers have a strange bond with gibbering mouthers, and a Whisperer family will keep a mouther somewhere in their home. When a family member reaches a certain age, they are fed to the mouther; the Whisperers believe that the soul of the departed lives forever in the mouther and can be heard in the gibbering. The name “Whisperer” comes from their tradition of prayer, a sort of ecstatic murmuring that mimics the chaotic gibbering of the mouther.


## 	The Court of Shadows

*   **Power: **Sul Khatesh
*   **Structure: **Transactional
*   A cabal of warlocks and wizards who serve the overlord Sul Khatesh in exchange for arcane knowledge and power. The current iteration of the Court began in Arcanix during the Last War, and is spreading across Khorvaire. Members are assigned a rank in the imaginary court of the Queen of Shadows; a warlock might be the Count of the Broken Bell or the Baroness of the Forgotten Moment.


## 	The Hive

*   **Power: **Valaara
*   **Structure: **Corrupted
*   Members of the Hive believe they are the children of Valaara, the Crawling Queen. Most believe they began their lives as insects, which then crawled into a humanoid body and consumed its brain. Hive cultists are compelled to work together, tirelessly pursuing the goals of their queen.


## 	The Inner Sun

*   **Power:** Katashka
*   **Structure:** Traditional
*   This cult can be found across the west coast of Khorvaire, from the [[Shadow Marches]] to the [[Demon Wastes]]. Cultists believe that there is a paradise within [[Khyber]]: the Vale of the Inner Sun. To earn passage to the Vale, a champion must defeat a host of worthy foes, dedicating their souls to the Gatekeeper. Cults vary on the criteria for “worthy foe”—while some cultists are serial killers, others only consider monsters or evildoers as qualifying for their passage.


## 	The Transcendent Flesh

*   **Power: **Dyrrn
*   **Structure: **Transactional
*   Followers of the Transcendent Flesh walk the paths of the Foul Labyrinth in a quest to evolve beyond the bodies they were born in. They work with mind flayers and other minions of Dyrrn the Corruptor, receiving their payment in symbionts, warlock powers, or other forms of physical or mental transformation.


## 	The Whispering Flame

*   **Power: **Bel Shalor
*   **Structure: **Traditional


## 	Revenants

*   **Power: **Varies
*   **Structure: **Corrupted
*   Not to be confused with the Revenant Blades of Valenar, members of revenant cults believe that they are ancient heroes reincarnated to serve a divine purpose. Revenants may operate alone, or a band of cultists may believe they are heroes from the same time period. Katashka, Rak Tulkhesh, and Dyrrn the Corruptor have all been known to produce revenant cults. The challenge of fighting a revenant cult is simple: How do you know they’re not reborn heroes with a vital purpose?


## 	Loyalists

*   **Power: **Varies
*   **Structure: **Varies
*   A common cult that can spring up anywhere, loyalists worship their immortal patron as a deity and are devoted to releasing it from [[Khyber]]. Traditional loyalists may have been slowly advancing their patron’s goals for centuries, worming their way into positions of influence and aiding their master’s inhuman minions. Corrupted loyalists are usually wildly dedicated to a single task, and the cult will dissolve if their attempt fails.
