House Sivis conducts a great deal of business in Sharn. As a center for international trade, communication is vitally important in Sharn, and there are over a dozen Sivis message stations in the city. House Kundarak is just one of the groups that employs Sivis scribes and accountants. Sivis mediators and barristers are in high demand in the courts of Sharn. And with the proximity of Xen’drik, there is always a call for skilled translators. The house performs all of these functions, and quite well. It maintains its policy of absolute neutrality with all forces in the city, including the Zilargo embassy. However, there are traditions to be upheld, and as a result House Sivis still fi ghts its one ancient enemy: House Sivis. The gnomes are engaged in constant battles of wits and intrigues. It is a delicate balancing act. The gnomes fi ght for power and position within the house, and humiliating a rival is the best way to gain advancement—demonstrating wit and cleverness while revealing the victim’s vulnerability. However, the schemer has to make sure that his actions do not sully the reputation of the house. Causing a Sivis barrister to lose his case may very well embarrass him—but it is also a black mark on Sivis as a whole. It is a tricky and delicate battlefield, and one that is diffi cult for outsiders to understand.
