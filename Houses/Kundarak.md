### Sharn

Sharn is one of the greatest centers of trade and commerce in Khorvaire, and it is small wonder that the House of Warding would have a strong presence in the city. For the most part, Kundarak’s only interest in Sharn is business. Aside from the vast amount of gold that fl ows through the Kundarak Bank each day, the house owns magically secured warehouses and sells magic and mundane locks, alarms, and traps to the many wealthy and powerful inhabitants of the city.

But while Kundarak tends to be a passive house, there are things that can stir it to action—notably, the loss of wealth. During the Last War, Breland took out vast loans from the Kundarak Bank to pay for the war effort. King Boranel has been coming up short on his payments, and the Kundarak elders are displeased. Acting on their behalf, [[Daphanë d’Kundarak]] has been talking with the members of the Brelish Parliament who wish to see the monarchy removed from power, notably [[Ruken ir'Clarn]] and [[Hass ir'Tain]]. Aside from satisfying the wounded pride of the house, this could provide Kundarak with considerable infl uence over the new prime minister—and this appeals to the elders.

In addition to locksmiths, vaultkeepers, and other professionals, the Sharn enclave includes 60 members of the elite Silver Guard, who protect the vaults and warehouses. These soldiers are exceptionally skilled, and are all fi ghters as opposed to warriors. The garrison is made up of 50 2nd-level fi ghters, 6 3rd-level fi ghters, 3 4th-level fi ghters, and 1 5th-level fi ghter. There is also a small team of adepts and magewrights who specialize in the creation of magic traps.
