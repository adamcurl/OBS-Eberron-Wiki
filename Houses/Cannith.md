#House

## History
### The Twelve
Lord Hadran d'Cannith was the founder of the The Twelve. Hadran d'Cannith proposed the wizard organization after the War of the Mark as a way to promote unity between the dragonmarked houses and pursue joint research of dragonmarks and other arcane magical phenomenon.

### The Warforged
**959 YK:** The first warforged titans were deployed in Cyre.
**965 YK:** Aaren d'Cannith perfects his father's, Merrix d'Cannith Sr, creation and gives the warforged sentience.
**996 YK:** Warforged are granted the rights of sentient beings, but all creation forges are outlawed.

### The Last War
Starrin d'Cannith, nickamed "the Gorgon", was the last patriarch of House Cannith. Starrin was highly influential as patriarch, convincing the warring kingdoms of House Cannith's neutrality and was instrumental in selling warforged to all sides of the Last War. He perished at the house's Eston enclave in Cyre on the Day of Mourning.

The only son of former Cannith patriarch Starrin d'Cannith, Norran died along with his father on the Day of Mourning in Cyre. Norran was the only direct descendant of Starrin and next in line to rule House Cannith, but Norran had fathered no children himself. With his death the house fell into chaos as to who would rule in his stead.

Merrix d'Cannith Sr was a former member of House Cannith and was the creator of the warforged. His son Aaren d'Cannith advanced the warforged by granting them sentience. His grandson of the same name Merrix d'Cannith is the current Baron of Cannith South.

Aaren protested what he saw as the abuse and enslavement of his creations, but his pleas were ignored. In 970 YK, Aaren was excoriated—formally disinherited from House Cannith. Following his expulsion, Aaren disappeared. His fate remains a mystery, and diviners and inquisitives have found no traces of him.

Starrin's death caused a succession crisis within House Cannith, as his appointed successor was his only son, Norran d'Cannith, who also perished in the Day of Mourning. With the house in disarray and with so many high-ranking officials suddenly dead, no one still within the house could come to a fair or just vote. Three rivals within the house each rose to claim the title, each one seeking to rule the powerful house.

Jorlanna d'Cannith, along with Merrix and Zorlan, each asserted their claim to be the next head of House Cannith. The House could not agree on which one would be the next successor, so the House split into three branches.

Haestus d'Cannith was the overseer of a House Cannith creation forge deep within a mountain near the border of Cyre and Breland. Haestus also had an interest in necromancy, and was investigating ways to combine the necromantic arts with House Cannith's artificer skills. They worked without direct oversight from House Cannith officials on new types of warforged prototypes.

Before the end of the Last War, a group of Karrnathi irregulars discovered the location of the facility. Realizing its importance to the Cyran war effort, the Karrnathis collapsed the facility, trapping all of the artificers within beneath tons of rubble. Haestus and his artificers died a slow death.

The exact location of Haestus's forge was lost in the fall of Cyre during the Day of Mourning, the same day that killed the Karrnathi irregulars. Haestus rose from death as a forgewraith, and continued the mission he had in life: creating warforged prototypes.

## Factions
### South
^e60b73

The southern faction is led by [[Merrix d’Cannith]], who makes his home in Sharn. House Cannith has always had a strong presence in the city. Cannith engineers and architects helped rebuild the city, and it was Cannith artificers who developed the flying buttress that allows for the construction of the enormous towers. During the war, the Cannith enclave in Sharn was one of the main production centers for the magic weapons and potions that Breland purchased from the house, including the majority of Breland’s warforged soldiers.

Today, House Cannith provides a wide variety of services within Sharn. House Cannith alchemists produce the bulk of the magic potions found in the city, and most 1st-level potions carry a Cannith seal. Cannith engineers and masons help with the continued development of Sharn, and just as importantly they help to repair and maintain the existing towers and suspended streets and roads. Cannith artificers maintain the spells powering the great foundries in the Cogs. Both of these duties are handled by Cannith heirs, but also by teams of skilled laborers trained and employed by the house.

One of the secrets of the house is that quite a few of its members are followers of the Traveler, in its aspect as the god of artifice. While this generally has little impact on things, it does form a common bond between some members of House Cannith and the Tyrant changelings.

The Cannith enclave in Dragon Towers is used for diplomatic relations, but most of the important work is done in the Forgehold, the industrial complex in the Ashblack district of the Upper Cogs. Smaller Cannith enclaves are scattered about the city, primarily alchemical workshops and outposts for the Tinkers Guild.

Sharn is also home to five members of the [[Darkwood Watch]], House Cannith’s elite wand-wielding soldiers. The squad leader is [[Menya d’Cannith]]. The Darkwood Watch is usually assigned to protect the Cannith Forgehold, and they are only used for extremely important tasks. As they are clearly recognizable as members of House Cannith, wand adepts are rarely used for covert operations.

### West
Cannith West is the branch of House Cannith led by [[Jorlanna d'Cannith]] and based out of Fairhaven, Aundair. It has a presence in Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches, and strong ties with the other dragonmarked houses through the Twelve. Jorlanna seeks to lead her branch into having stronger ties with the Five Nations and the other dragonmarked houses.

Some time after the split, Jorlanna used her diplomatic skills to negotiate with the Wardens of the Wood to gain access to sites in the Eldeen Reaches, and get into the good graces of the Twelve.

### East
[[Zorlan d'Cannith]] has done much in Karrnath, where the was only one outpost of the House but now there are many. This branch was known for tearing administration and diplomacy before the day of Mourning. Cannith East still expertise in siege warfare and house members serve as advisors to Karrn generals. The Branch has taken in the Karnnathi culture. Members of this house think of undead as a necromantic equivalent of Warforged. Cannith East seeks to create a new form of construct undead, animated with eldritch power and a bound ghostly intelligence. They have also taken up worshiping the Blood of Vol. Zorlan is a devout follower of the Blood of Vol.
