## Bio
Talleon is devoted to the preservation of Breland and to the King, but he is utterly ruthless, and authorizes torture, theft, and assassination if a mission requires it. He has built up a network of Lower City contacts, and has engaged in “friendly deals” with the Tyrants, the Boromar Clan, and even House Tarkanan. Talleon doesn’t care about crime; he wants to expose and eliminate foreign spies, saboteurs, or other threats to the kingdom. He is also interested in increasing his own personal authority; the more power he has, the more effectively he can do his job. If Talleon ever gets a chance to take command from Knight-Marshal Banarak, he will seize it. Until then, he continues to form strategic alliances with guilds and power groups throughout the city.
