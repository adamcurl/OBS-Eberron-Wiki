## Bio
He spends most of his time in negotiations, discussing trade, the reconstruction of Khorvaire, and the exploration of Xenâ€™drik. However, he is a philosopher and historian, and when he is not at the embassy or attending a gala event, he often visits Morgrave University. Jorasesh is slowly developing a following at the University; he is brilliant and charismatic, and students and sages alike are intrigued by the handsome Inspired lord.

Jorasesh and his entourage have no direct attachment to the Dreaming Dark, and Jorasesh knows nothing about the shadow agents the Dark has placed throughout the city. However, Jorasesh is required to obey the commands of any Inspired member of the Dreaming Dark who comes to Sharn, and these agents often stay at the embassy under some form of diplomatic cover.
