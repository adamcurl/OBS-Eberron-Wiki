## Bio
Councilor of Lower Tavick’s Landing. Whispered rumors suggest that the changeling has ties to the mysterious Tyrants. Some insist that Kilk is actually an identity shared by a group of changelings.

Kilk has the support of the Tyrants, but has also won the loyalty of the other merchant lords of the district. On the surface, it appears that Kilk looks out for the mercantile interests of his ward, but he also monitors and manipulates events across the city. Only Thurik Davandi can match Kilk for intrigues and scheming, and Kilk has a web of informants and spies across the city. He has done his best to make himself useful to the King’s Citadel and the Guardians of the Gate, and as a result he has developed powerful allies within both organizations.

Kilk is an invention of the Tyrants. There is one changeling who plays the role more often than others, but at any time Kilk could be any one of the Tyrants—even Ek himself. Through Kilk, the Tyrants have a second way to affect the city, and a more respectable façade for dealing with groups such as the King’s Citadel.
