## Bio
Marrix leads House Cannith’s Sharn enclave and the Southern faction. Though he is the youngest of the three and has the weakest familial connection to Starrin, his rivals are wary of his incredible talents as an artificer and his driving ambition.

Merrix has little interest in reuniting the house; he doesn’t care for either of his younger cousins, and he intends to keep the southern house on the same paths of research and production that it was on before the destruction of Cyre. Merrix does have two interests: the warforged and the Mournland. Merrix’s grandfather developed the first warforged, and Merrix has been secretly continuing this work, maintaining the creation forge in the depths of Sharn and trying to produce new and improved warforged designs. He is fascinated by stories of strange constructs and artifacts found in Xen’drik, and has speculated that his grandfather and the other artificers who created the first warforged may have been using secrets recovered from the lost continent. He is also concerned about the fate of the warforged in this new time of peace, and has been trying to help the living constructs adapt.

Merrix’s second area of interest is the Mournland, and he may hire adventurers to explore the blasted realm or to recover lost Cannith artifacts. If one of the party members is a warforged, Merrix may take a personal interest in this character. The Cannith heir would certainly be a powerful patron for a warforged hero.
