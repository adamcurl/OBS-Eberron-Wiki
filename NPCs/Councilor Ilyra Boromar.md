## Bio
Councilor for Lower Dura, but it’s common knowledge that her true allegiance is to her family and its criminal empire. Eldest daughter of Saidan and Mala. The current ongoing conflict with Daask has weakened her family and her position.

She is the Boromar Clan’s personal representative on the Council. She reports directly to Saidan Boromar, and she has the authority to make executive decisions on behalf of the clan. Her allegiance is obvious, but the other council members generally politely overlook it; the Boromars are one of the Sixty families of Sharn, and she does have the skills, credentials, and lineage to compete with any of the other councilors.

Of all of the members of the council, Ilyra is the most ruthless and dangerous. The Boromar Clan prefers to avoid violence, but councilors who oppose Ilyra have disappeared in the past. However, the recent war with Daask has shaken her grip on the council. The Boromar Clan is no longer seen as an infallible, omnipotent force—and so far the majority councilors have refused to devote city resources to battling the Droaamites setting up shop in Sharn. Most are quite pleased with the turn of events, and are waiting for the Boromars to be weakened further before they take any action.

[[Councilor Thurik Davandi]], [[Councilor Bestan ir’Tonn]], and [[Councilor Caskar Halavik]] are Ilyra’s allies, although Thurik and Bestan have been known to pursue there own agendas behind Ilyra’s back. Her greatest enemies on the council are [[Councilor Borian Haldorak]], [[Councilor Sava Kharisa]], [[Councilor Kilk]], and [[Councilor Hruitt]] ; these four are either unconcerned with the danger represented by the Boromar Clan or feel that their supporters are powerful enough to protect them from retribution.
