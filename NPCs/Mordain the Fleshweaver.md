## Bio
The wizard Mordain (NE male elf transmuter 18) was banished from the Twelve (see page 245) more than two centuries ago because of the unorthodox and disturbing experiments he conducted. Mordain seeks to master the magic of the daelkyr, the fiendish beings who created the mind flayers and many of the other aberrations that haunt the depths of Khyber. Malformed flesh golems and strange, disfigured creatures—the results of his horrific experiments—patrol the land around his keep, Mordain’s Hall. A master transmuter and a deadly foe, Mordain is obsessed with his work and has no interest in the outside world. The Daughters of Sora Kell and their followers avoid the lands around Mordain’s tower, and he in turn leaves them alone.
