## Bio
Demise is a rising star in the ranks of the Order of the Emerald Claw. Born in Aerenal, she was fascinated with the legends of the House of Vol and soon fell in with the disturbing sect known as the Stillborn. She possessed a natural gift for necromancy and was soon recruited into the ranks of the Order of the Emerald Claw. She is fanatically devoted to the order, and dreams of someday becoming a lich and serving at the side of ancient Vol herself. For the moment, she oversees small operations, leading groups of lesser minions (skeletons, zombies, or low-level warriors, rogues, or clerics of the Blood of Vol) as they work to steal valuable items or perform dark rituals.

She appears to be a zombie or a lich, but in fact her skin condition is artifi cially induced, and she is perfectly healthy and alive. Those who spot her decaying fl esh, which is far more obvious should she remove her mask, may be baffl ed by her ability to resist turning, disrupt undead, and similar effects.

When dealing with others, Demise has a chillingly nihilistic attitude. She constantly challenges all the heroes’ achievements, encouraging them to give up their struggle and surrender to the inevitability of death.

Demise prefers to stay out of range of melee combat. She uses scare to disrupt her enemies, and if she lacks minions she draws a creature from her robe of bones, using command undead to control it.
