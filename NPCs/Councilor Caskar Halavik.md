## Bio
He is the representative of the Middle Menthis ward of Sharn on the Council. An immigrant to Sharn from the Talenta Plains, Caskar made a name for himself in the Little Plains district for his skill at clawfoot racing. Caskar often sides with Ilyra Boromar on council decisions.

When he fi rst came to Sharn, he worked as an enforcer for the Boromar Clan. Saiden Boromar helped him transform his fame into political cachet, eventually earning him a seat on the Council.
