## Bio
Kryx joined the organization in 996 YK after three years of distinguished service in the Brelish army. He joined Captain Vron’s personal retinue and, in no time, demonstrated a knack for keeping secrets. When Vron needed a warforged agent to gather intelligence on the Lord of Blades in the Mournland, he could think of no one better than Kryx for the job. Kryx’s orders were simple: Locate and infi ltrate the Lord of Blades’ camp, ascertain the size of his army, and learn the warlord’s plans. More than a year has passed, and Kryx has not yet returned. The popular theory is that the Lord of Blades learned of Kryx’s mission and destroyed him, but Vron hopes than Kryx is still in the Mournland, attempting to subvert the Lord of Blades’ efforts. A few detractors think Kryx may have fallen under the warlord’s sway and given up his allegiance to Breland. In time, Vron hopes to send a team of well-equipped agents into the Mournland to ascertain the truth.
