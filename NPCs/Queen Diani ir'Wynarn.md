## Bio
Diani tries her best to preserve the traditions of her people while striving to keep the monarchy relevant. One day she hopes to seize power in Thrane, but she knows she cannot accomplish this alone. To date, she remains little more than a political fi gurehead. Theocrats regard her as an expert in etiquette within the rarefi ed world of the nobility. Her rivals regard her as a tragically beautiful woman whose sole function is to look elegant at formal events. They would be wise, however, not to underestimate her.

Diani uses Thalingard, the royal palace in the capital city of Flamekeep, as her primary residence throughout the year. Here, she keeps one finger on the pulse of her nation. However, Diani often retreats to Silvercliff Castle, her family’s summer residence, to meet privately with those who can advance her personal agenda. Diani holds audiences with nobles from other kingdoms, particularly ones whom the theocracy regards as irrelevant. High Cardinal Krozen, in particular, meets only with nobles and diplomats who can advance his own schemes, leaving Diani to conspire with the ones he neglects. Behind the stately balls, gentle rhetoric, and majestic gatherings of her court, enemies of the theocracy speak with her about subtle political intrigues, rivalries in other noble courts, and hints of machinations within neighboring Aundair, Breland, and Karrnath. On many occasions, Diani has diverted private funds to hire discreet adventurers to undermine the efforts of her enemies, namely the theocrats. Most of the time she uses intermediaries to hire adventurers; when obliged to deal with adventurers directly, she normally adopts a disguise.

Although she secretly opposes what Jaela Daran represents, Diani likes the young Keeper of the Flame and does what she can to help Jaela make decisions that are both wise and in the best interests of her people.

Diani believes that the theocracy will be proven corrupt or incompetent, and that the good citizens of Thrane will one day restore her lineage to its rightful position of authority. Until then, she remains a silent representative of what arrogant clerics regard as a lost age.
