## Bio
District commander of Black Arch. The daughter of the Lord Commander, Iyanna is the only commander with an actual interest in helping the people. Over the last two years she has fought to purge the corruption in the Black Arch Watch, and she has had some success. Of all of the quarters of Sharn, Tavickâ€™s Landing is the place where a party is most likely to encounter an honest and helpful guard, and if they need a friend in the Watch, Iyanna is the person they should look to. However, Iyanna is not making many friends among other ranking offi cers of the Watch or the crime lords of the lower towers.
