## Bio
Borian owes his position to the powerful bankers and merchants of Highhold. He is also a member of the Gold Concord of the Aurum, and serves the interests of this conspiracy. He is disarmingly cheerful and often plays up his age, telling elaborate stories about the great deeds of his youth. But beneath this fa√ßade, he is a sharp and ruthless negotiator. Most interactions between the Aurum and the Boromar Clan are resolved by Borian and Ilyra.
