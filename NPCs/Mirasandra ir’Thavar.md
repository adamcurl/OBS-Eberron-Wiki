## Bio
Mirasandra ir’Thavar is the eldest daughter of a Cyran politician. On the Day of Mourning, she was in Taer Valaestas with her father, who was negotiating a treaty with High King Vadallia of the Valenar elves. Word of Cyre’s destruction came quickly, and Mira’s father ordered her to remain in Taer Valaestas while he and his entourage returned to Metrol to assess the damage. She never saw him again. The only other member of her immediate family who survived Cyre’s destruction was her aunt Magdalora, who was visiting Korranberg at the time. Magdalora has since relocated to Sharn, and the two have drifted apart. Magdalora doesn’t share her niece’s thirst for vengeance and believes that Cyrans have no one to blame but themselves—a view Mirasandra considers ludicrous.

Mirasandra prefers to attack from afar, peppering foes with arrows while she takes advantage of cover. Although she one day hopes to unravel the mystery of the Mournland’s creation, she has grown increasingly preoccupied with goblin activity along the Breland– Darguun border. Darguul raiders have launched bold strikes against Cyran refugees in Breland, and Mirasandra has taken it upon herself to slay every last goblinoid that rears its ugly head. She also attacks scouting parties and caravans heading to and from Gorgonhorn and Skullreave in northern Darguun. Characters traveling through Marguul Pass or exploring Darguun’s northern reaches may encounter Mirasandra or one of several goblin war bands searching for her.
