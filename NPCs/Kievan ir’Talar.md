## Bio
Kievan ir’Talar escaped the doldrums of the aristocracy by studying wizardry under the tutelage of Vadi ir’Savaci of Sigilstar. Vadi introduced Kievan to an old friend named Gennara ir’Damilek. As the head of the Order of the Pure, Gennara invited Kievan to join the Order as an Initiate of the Seventh Circle, and he agreed. He has since risen to the rank of Adept of the Third Circle. At this point, he’s ready to log some “fi eld time” and join an experienced group of adventurers on a quest or two.
