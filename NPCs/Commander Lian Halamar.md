## Bio
Commander of the Daggerwatch garrison. Lianâ€™s connections to the Boromar Clan helped him rise to his current rank, but he is not a puppet to his halfl ing brethren. Lian presses the Boromars just hard enough to make sure they keep up their regular payments. As a result, parties might get lucky and receive some help from the Watch when fi ghting Boromars. But more often than not, the Watch is nowhere to be found during major Clan operations. Recently, the Boromars have been pressing Lian to take stronger action against Daask, but the halfling has no interest in getting caught in the middle of the crime war erupting in the lower towers.
