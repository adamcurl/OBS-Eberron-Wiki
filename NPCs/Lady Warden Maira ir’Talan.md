## Bio
The commanding officer of the Blackened Book. Five years ago the Dreaming Dark suborned Maira, and she is actually a mind seed of the Inspired dominator Tirashana. Today Maira uses her position to provide the Inspired with information and to conceal the activities of the other agents of the Dreaming Dark. While Maira is a member of the ir’Talan line, she is from the Wroat ir’Talans and is only a distant relative of the Lord Commander of the Sharn Watch.
