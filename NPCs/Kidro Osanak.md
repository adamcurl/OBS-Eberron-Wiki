## Bio
A wizened old gnome, Kidro harbors a deep resentment toward Haga Wissel, and though he can’t prove it, believes that she has stolen items from his shop. One of the only dealers in Little Xen’drik with more interest in the historical knowledge contained in his treasures than in their monetary worth, Kidro often sponsors the most challenging expeditions. 

He runs Windows on Yesterday.
