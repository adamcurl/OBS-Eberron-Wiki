## Bio
Councillor of Middle Central. An elder statesman and a brilliant orator, he is rumored to be involved in a web of bribery and graft. He is deeply invested in the economy, and especially the growing wealth gap between Upper and Middle Central, which he is quite frustrated by. He has a rivalry with fellow councilman Javan Tomollan.

His frustration is compounded by the rising success of Javan Tomollan, and every month he becomes increasingly obsessed with Tomollan. Sorik is determined to humiliate Javan and to bring down his fortunes, but he needs to be careful.
