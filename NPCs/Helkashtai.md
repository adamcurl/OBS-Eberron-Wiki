## Bio
Jorasesh’s aide-de-camp. In addition to her administrative duties, she has become a fi xture in the social scene of Sharn, and can be found at most of the major gatherings of the rich and powerful. She is beautiful and charming, and many of the aristocrats have come to value her skills as a mediator. A few young nobles have even sought her hand in marriage, although she has rejected all offers. Like Jorasesh, her warm and friendly demeanor is a mask—a carefully crafted tool to help her gain infl uence within the upper classes. The Inspired are ruthless manipulators, and human lives and emotions are simply toys for their amusement.
