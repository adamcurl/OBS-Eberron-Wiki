## Bio
Chance owns Chance, and is also a powerful priest of the Traveler. Almost nothing is known about Chance; the doppelganger wears a different guise every night, and the only way to recognize Chance is by the distinctive amulet it wears.

Chance is not an agent of the Tyrant guild. It respects the guild and may provide magical assistance to guild members, but it serves the Traveler in its own way and stands above the guilds and politics of the city.
