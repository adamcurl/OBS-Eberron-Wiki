## Bio
Runs a small agency whose members can fi nd out anything a client wants to know—for a price. Karr’Aashta has a reputation for taking on cases that the other Tharashk inquisitives won’t touch, and he specializes in jobs dealing with the Cogs. However, ‘Aashta has a secret—he is a follower of the Dragon Below. The Cults of the Dragon Below are a factious bunch, and often fi ght one another. As a result, ‘Aashta’s allegiance could help conceal the activities of a cult or lead them to the adventurers—or he could provide the adventurers with information they need to locate a cult and upset its plans, to serve the ends of his own sect.
