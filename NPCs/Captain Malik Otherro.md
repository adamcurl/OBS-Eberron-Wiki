## Bio
Malik Otherro took an oath to defend the royal family and the citizens of Thrane. As Shadukar burned, he led a large force of knights into the ruins to locate survivors and dispatch the Karrnathi looters. When Thrane’s populace vilifi ed Diani for failing to prevent the catastrophe, Captain Otherro stood by her side. Court insiders suspect that the handsome paladin’s unswerving loyalty hides some behind-the-scenes romance. Dzarro is aware of Otherro’s feelings for the queen and has privately discouraged the paladin from pursuing her, reminding him of his duty to Thrane and the Church. Nevertheless, Captain Otherro often confers with Diani often about political maneuverings, military threats, and the fate of the nation. For her part, Diani is terribly fond of Malik but has no plans to pursue him.

The lawful paladin struggles to remain true to his station, enacting the will of the ruling theocracy while concealing his love for Diani. When the Council of Cardinals summons him, he answers the call promptly, and without fail. Fate may invariably compel him to choose Diani over his duty, but only time will tell.

Captain Otherro’s mount is a magebred heavy warhorse named Thaedrar (Elven for “summer wind”).
