## Bio
Cyran ambassador to Sharn. Jairan still plays the role of the proud noble, attending social functions in his fi ne clothes, but he lost his fortune on the Day of Mourning and his glamerweave doublets are becoming increasingly threadbare. Jairan is an optimist, and he believes that somehow if he keeps doing his job Cyre will be restoredâ€”that New Cyre can peacefully grow, and perhaps reclaim the blasted Mournland.
