## Description
- **Appearance:** Mayne Jhaelian wears the black and gold robes of a priest of the Undying Court, with the golden mask of the Court on a chain around his neck. But beneath this fi nery his skin is mottled and cold, and his vivid green eyes are the only sign of life in his frozen face. His voice is a rasping whisper, as if it is diffi cult for him to draw breath into rotting lungs.
