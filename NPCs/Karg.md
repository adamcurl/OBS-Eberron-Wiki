## Description
- **Appearance:** Karg is small for an ogre—only 8 and a half feet tall, if that—but broad and covered with muscle. He is remarkably well groomed; his black hair has been braided and oiled, and his leather armor has been carefully polished. But while he has clearly tried to make himself more presentable to humans, his rank body odor still assails your nostrils and his skin is covered with old scars and boils, disturbing remnants of some terrible disease. He seems remarkably friendly, but he has a massive greatsword strapped to his back, the blade hidden in a worn leather scabbard.

Karg loves the sword and never lets it out of his sight.
