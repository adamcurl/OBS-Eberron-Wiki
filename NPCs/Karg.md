## Description
- **Appearance:** Karg is small for an ogre—only 8 and a half feet tall, if that—but broad and covered with muscle. He is remarkably well groomed; his black hair has been braided and oiled, and his leather armor has been carefully polished. But while he has clearly tried to make himself more presentable to humans, his rank body odor still assails your nostrils and his skin is covered with old scars and boils, disturbing remnants of some terrible disease. He seems remarkably friendly, but he has a massive greatsword strapped to his back, the blade hidden in a worn leather scabbard.

Karg an exceptionally intelligent ogre (Intelligence 10) who stumbled upon a cache of Dhakaani treasure a few years ago. Knowing that one of the more powerful monsters would take this prize away from him if he stayed in Droaam, Karg came to Sharn. He has spent the last four years studying at Morgrave University; he wants to become a master sage, and he is particularly fascinated by the history of Xen’drik and the empire of the giants. Karg is afraid of Daask, and does not venture into Lower Dura or the Cogs.
