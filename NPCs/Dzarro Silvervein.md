## Bio
Dzarro, a sly silver-bearded Mror dwarf with a bejeweled leather eye patch, has served the royal family of Thrane for 142 years. He was King Thalin’s gruff companion and trusted advisor until Thalin’s death in 914 YK. To honor his departed friend, Dzarro vowed to protect Thalin’s children and grandchildren. Queen Diani views Dzarro more as a steward and advisor than a bodyguard but does not discount his martial prowess.

As much as he feels that faith in the Silver Flame is important to the nation’s well-being, Dzarro thinks that Thrane’s people betrayed Thalin’s family by allowing the Church to rule in their place. He holds most of the cardinals in low regard (and loathes High Cardinal Krozen in particular) but respects Captain Otherro and the Knights of Thrane. He works closely with Otherro, particularly when overseeing security during one of Queen Diani’s public appearances.
