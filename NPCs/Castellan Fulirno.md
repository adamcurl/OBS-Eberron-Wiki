## Bio
Queen Aurala doesn’t grant an audience to unannounced visitors, no matter how outlandish their tales. It falls to Castellen Adele Fulirno to interview and vet those who have business for the queen or any of the senior ministers. Fulirno works closely with the queen and has a strong, but not infallible sense of the queen’s priorities. She even suspects that Aurala’s ambitions lie beyond leading Aundair to claiming the Galifar crown at Thronehold.
