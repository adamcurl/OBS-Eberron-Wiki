## Bio
Councilor of Skyway. Lady Marasha owns the Celestial Vista restaurant, along with several other valuable businesses. She’s an eloquent speaker who supports many radical positions, including abolishing the monarchy after the death of King Boranel and recognizing Sharn as an independent province.

She is one of the most eloquent members of the Council, and she takes a great interest in Sharn’s role in the greater politics of Breland. She is part of the cabal who believe that the monarchy should be abolished when King Boranel dies, and she is a close friend of [[Hass ir'Tain]]. Evix also believes that Sharn should be recognized as an independent province, a view shared by [[Councilor Sava Kharisa]]. However, first and foremost she represents the people of Skyway and the interests of these wealthiest citizens of Sharn. Because of this, she usually sides with [[Councilor Javan Tomollan]], [[Councilor Maza Thadian]], and [[Councilor Bestan ir’Tonn]] in Council debates.
