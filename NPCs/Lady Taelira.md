## Bio
Taelira is the consul of Aerenal, and has held this post for over 300 years. Taelira has little interest in the wars or confl icts of the younger races, and she is unlikely to take an interest in anything that adventurers bring to her attention; if there’s a problem, her inclination is to wait a year and see if it’s still an issue. Trade agreements are an exception to this rule, and Taelira is a vicious negotiator when it comes to protecting the economic interests of the elves.

While she is rarely helpful, Lady Taelira shows more respect toward characters who possess the Right of Counsel. She is also a confi dant of Mayne Jhaelian, the priest of Shae Lias, and if Mayne sends the characters to Taelira, she listens.
