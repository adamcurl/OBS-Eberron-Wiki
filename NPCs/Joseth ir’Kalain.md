## Bio
Joseth is a clever negotiator and shrewd judge of human nature, but he is an honorable man who believes in the ideals of the old kingdom. He lacks the resources of an embassy, but Joseth is a possible patron for a group of adventurers. While he lives modestly, Joseth owns a dragonshard mine in Q’barra, and can draw considerable funds from the Kundarak Bank. The fi rst Q’barrans fl ed east to escape the Last War, and Joseth may need to recover family heirlooms, information, or other treasures lost during this exodus. Joseth does not trust the people of Sharn, and he is far more likely to recruit his own agents; if a party contains a character from Q’barra, all the better.
