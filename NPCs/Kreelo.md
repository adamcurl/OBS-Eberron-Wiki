## Bio
The most wanted criminal in Fairhaven, Kreelo leads the Dark Dagger Gang. His control of the city’s underworld is far from absolute, but his gang is the city’s strongest.

The Dark Daggers make most of their money running protection rackets and smuggling contraband (everything from poisons and evil magic to barrels of untaxed wine) into and out of the city. If the PCs do any significant business with Fairhaven’s black marketeers, they have a good chance of attracting Kreelo’s attention.

Kreelo was a bold changeling as a youth—while in disguise, he even met Queen Aurala—but now he rarely leaves his bodyguards and the safety of the abandoned Silver Flame cathedral from which he controls his criminal empire. He knows that everyone from the Royal Eyes to rival gang lords would love to put his head on a pike.
