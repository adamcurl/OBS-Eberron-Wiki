## Bio
Margana is an up-and-coming member of the Arcane Congress and a professor in divination magic at the wizard academy within the floating towers of Arcanix. Instruction, however, holds no lure for her; she wants to amass power both within the Arcane Congress and beyond it.

In this respect, Margana is a typical member of the Arcane Congress. She might be part of the Mosaic Committee (described earlier in this chapter), she might be one of the wizards the PCs meet in a random encounter within the fl oating towers, or she could be teacher to a PC wizard. It’s a simple matter to change her alignment, specialty school, or equipment—or transplant her from the Arcane Congress entirely.
