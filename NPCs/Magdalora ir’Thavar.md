## Bio
The only other member of Mirasandra ir'Thavar's immediate family who survived Cyre’s destruction was her aunt Magdalora, who was visiting Korranberg at the time. Magdalora has since relocated to Sharn, and the two have drifted apart. Magdalora doesn’t share her niece’s thirst for vengeance and believes that Cyrans have no one to blame but themselves—a view Mirasandra considers ludicrous.

Magdalora ir’Thavar might hire the characters to locate her niece, either to bring her to justice or to reveal something she’s recently learned about the destruction of Cyre.
