## Bio
The local commander of the Citadel is Knight Marshal Banarak Tithon, renowned as one of the deadliest swordsmen in the kingdom. Tithonâ€™s wife and children were killed by an Aundairian mystical assault near the end of the Last War, and his service to the Crown is all that he has left. Banarak has a good heart, but he is increasingly distant and distracted, and leaves more and more of the daily work in the hands of his subordinates. While Tithon oversees all Citadel operations in Sharn, the Dark Lanterns are under the direct command of Captain Talleon Haliar Tonan.
