## Bio
Haydith ir’Wynarn, fifteen-year-old sister of King Kaius III of Karrnath, arrived in Wroat a year ago as part of an exchange program designed to solidify the peace accords ratifi ed by the Treaty of Thronehold. In truth, she knows that she is a hostage for her brother’s hard-won peace, but she has grown to like the rustic charm of the Brelish countryside—and she has grown to love the nation’s leader, King Boranel.

Haydith came to Wroat miserable and depressed. Her brother had changed almost from the moment he donned the crown of Karrnath, and then he decided to send her away from her family and friends. She started her sojourn in Wroat shy and quiet, keeping the worst of her depression to herself. But conversations with King Boranel slowly brought her out of herself and opened her up to the wonders and excitement of Wroat and the Brelish countryside. Now she has become a constant companion of the king, a regular at court functions, and a darling of the nobility. Haydith still worries that her brother’s letters are often short and to the point—the kingship has seemed to drive all the love out of him, and that worries her.

On a recent visit to Sharn with King Boranel, Haydith fell in love with the City of Towers. When her “studies” in Wroat come to an end, she might want to spend some time exploring the heights and depths of Sharn.
