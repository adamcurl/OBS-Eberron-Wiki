## Bio
The commander of the embassy guard. The guard is comprised of 12 highly trained human soldiers, each one a 2nd-level fi ghter/3rdlevel monk. To date, the embassy guard has never been called into service, so the people of Sharn know nothing about the extent of their skills. Minharkhad himself is cold and cruel. Unlike Helkashtai and Jorasesh, Minharkhad has trouble concealing his disdain for humanity, and as a result he is rarely seen outside of the embassy.
