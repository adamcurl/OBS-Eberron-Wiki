## Bio
Molin Kaine is one of the few Redcloaks who enjoys being posted to the city. While indulging his many vices, Molin has crossed paths with House Tarkanan and its leader, Lady Thora. Thora has been luring him into the service of the houseâ€”but the Redcloak is interested in more than a working relationship with the crime lord.
