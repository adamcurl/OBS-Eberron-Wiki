## Bio
The Sharn Daask cell is led by the ogre mage Cavallah. Cunning and exceptionally charismatic, Cavallah has gained considerable infl uence among the goblinoids of Malleon’s Gate and the Cogs. Cavallah is far more concerned with order and discipline than many of her soldiers, and she is personally responsible for planning Daask’s campaign against the Boromars. She is a scholar, and in her free time she studies the effects of the manifest zone of Sharn; she is fascinated by the ways that the city has incorporated the magic of fl ight and may attempt to obtain artifacts or magic items that relate to the manifest zone.

Cavallah is at home in the air. While she prefers to close and shatter her opponent’s weapons, she makes full use of her perfect aerial maneuverability, especially if she needs to escape. The benefits of Manifest Flight have already been included in her speed. Her hag eye is her connection to Sora Katra, who sends her instructions using sending.

Cavallah usually uses the minimum force required to complete the objective; she wants to conceal her power, and won’t send Cazha and a force of trolls if she thinks that Keshta and a half-dozen gnolls can handle the situation.

Cavallah respects the Mockery and the Shadow and has restored their altars, but for the most part the temple was simply a convenient base of operations. She has established a range of defenses in the temple, and brought a variety of unpleasant beasts from Droaam: gricks, displacer beasts, basilisks, and an assortment of other deadly creatures. The wealth gathered by Droaam lies in the vaults of this temple—but seizing it would be a dangerous task.
