## Bio
Luca Syara, the resident playwright of the Diamond Theater in Lower Menthis, is a ghaele eladrin who has taken on human form. At the start of the Last War she abandoned her post on the plane of Thelanis to participate in what she thought was the righteous cause of Cyre. After fi ghting on Cyre’s side for more than half a century, she became disillusioned. On Thelanis, she had watched the world from on high; on Eberron, she saw thousands of mortals die over words and lines on a map. She could not return to Thelanis. Her sense of idealism had been torn from her. In addition, she had been forbidden to fi ght in the war in the fi rst place, and the overlords of Thelanis seek to punish her for her transgression. So she hides, trying to find meaning in this world of mud and death.

When the war ended, Luca came to Sharn and chose to live among mortals once more. She began to produce plays. She found a place in the Diamond Theater, and over the last two years her star has rapidly risen in Sharn society. Scholars and philosophers spend hours debating her works in the taverns of the University district. Luca is much sought after as a guest at social events and Morgrave functions. But Luca rarely makes public appearances. She does not write in order to gain fame or fortune. Instead, she writes to ease the torment in her soul.

Luca is one of the most powerful beings in Sharn, but she labors under multiple handicaps. First and foremost, she is restrained by her own despair. She feels that in the long run no physical action will make a difference—that saving a single mortal life is merely postponing the inevitable. She defends herself if she is threatened, but she does not act to protect others. Even if she should be roused from her despair, using a cleric spell of 5th level or higher—such as raise dead—would reveal her presence to the powers of Thelanis, who still seek to call her to judgment.

In the long run, Luca could become a valuable ally for the party. But winning the spirit of the ghaele back from the shroud of gloom should be a long battle—and one that should not be won until the party is powerful enough to consider the eladrin to be an equal.

Luca wears a pair of gloves of storing. One glove holds her +4 holy greatsword. The other holds a large book fi lled with notes for plays.

Luca’s disguise hides her true nature from mortal eyes, but she cannot fool the fi ends. While she is no longer interested in battling evil, the Lords of Dust do not know that—and they may attempt to destroy the eladrin.
