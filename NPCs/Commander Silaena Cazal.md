## Bio
Silaena has served on the Watch for over a century, and in that time she has spread her net of graft and extortion across the plateau. The people of Upper and Middle Menthis are well protected—provided they make their payments on time. Silaena’s mother was expelled from House Phiarlan for possessing an aberrant dragonmark, and ultimately committed suicide. As a result, Silaena despises the dragonmarked houses—she takes every opportunity to make life difficult for one of these aristocrats. While Silaena does not possess an aberrant mark of her own, she is still angry about what happened to her mother and has begun to secretly assist House Tarkanan.
