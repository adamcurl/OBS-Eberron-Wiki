## Bio
Thothar is one of the city’s best-known gadfl ies, a soapbox orator who advocates nonviolent “revolution of the masses” and a democracy so laissez-faire that it borders on anarchy. The Royal Eyes keeps a close eye on him and arrests him periodically, but Thothar is careful not to explicitly advocate elimination of the crown or violence against any government apparatus.

Most Fairhaveners regard Thothar with a sympathetic ear, even if they realize that a consensus-driven society would never come to pass. But because Thothar moves in all circles of Fairhaven’s civic life, he’s one of the most well-informed residents of the city, capable of dishing out more rumor, gossip, and little-known fact than the nosiest courtier. He’s also an attentive student of magic, a knack he claims is a result of “a clear-headed revolution of the mind.”

Thothar willingly casts legend lore, identify, or other spells in his repertoire on behalf of characters whom he thinks have the potential to become altruistic revolutionaries. If he doesn’t think you have suffi cient revolutionary fervor, however, no amount of money will change his mind.

Thothar is also a good source when PCs are making Gather Information checks within Fairhaven. He can be found in nearly any ward of the city, preaching a rose-colored future from a box on the sidewalk.
