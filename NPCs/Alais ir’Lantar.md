## Bio
Alais and Helais ir’Lantar, sons of one of the noble families of Aundair, serve the interests of their nation in Sharn. Alais and Helais are identical twin brothers, and both are remarkably handsome and urbane; they are quite popular at galas and other social events. While both brothers are officially ambassadors, each performs different duties. Alais deals with the administrative drudgery.

Alais is well aware of his brother’s true nature. He is a cruel, conniving man who enjoys assisting the Lords of Dust with their schemes. In addition to the power he gains from the alliance, Alais feels that his connection to the rakshasas puts him above mere mortals; he suffers from the delusion that if he serves the Lords faithfully, he may one day be transformed into a rakshasa himself.
