## Bio
Daphane is the leader of the Sharn Kundarak enclave. She is one of the more respected members of the house, and is in many ways more influential than Ilde d’Kundarak, the regional director of Wroat. Daphanë is a fair woman, but she never forgets a slight, never forgives a broken promise, and has a strong appetite for vengeance.

Acting on their behalf, Daphanë d’Kundarak has been talking with the members of the Brelish Parliament who wish to see the monarchy removed from power, notably Lord Ruken ir’Clarn and Hass ir’Tain. Aside from satisfying the wounded pride of the house, this could provide Kundarak with considerable infl uence over the new prime minister—and this appeals to the elders.
