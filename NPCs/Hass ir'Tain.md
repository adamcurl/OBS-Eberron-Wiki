## Bio
Is the heir apparent to the ir’Tain fortune. Hass is a member of the Breland Parliament and spends most of his time in Wroat, but returns on occasion to visit his mother and siblings. Hass ir’Tain is an ardent supporter of Lord [[Duken ir’Clarn]] and his plan to abolish the Brelish monarchy after the death of King Boranel; while he believes that members of the aristocracy are inherently better equipped to lead than commoners, he fi rmly believes that the blood of King Jarot is weak and that the time has come to set the monarchy aside. While Duken is willing to wait for Boranel to die of natural causes, Hass is less patient. Working with other members of the conspiracy at court, Hass has been considering various ways to embarrass the monarchy or even to hasten the demise of King Boranel. Hass is not hungry for power, and he believes that Duken should be the prime minister after the fall of the monarchy; he is actually pleased that Duken does not stoop to such methods and feels that it shows his worthiness to rule. But he is prepared to perform these questionable acts in the service of the country—and he occasionally hires adventures to do his dirty work.
