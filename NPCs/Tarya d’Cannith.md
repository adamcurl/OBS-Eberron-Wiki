## Bio
During the war, Tarya helped to streamline the production of healing potions and alchemist’s fire, both of which were in high demand. Currently, she is concerned and intrigued by dragon’s blood. She is trying to identify the source of the elixir, the secret of its composition, and what possible side effects might be hidden in the brew. Once she discovers its source, she might hire adventurers to go to Droaam to discover its true nature and purpose.
