## Bio
The current Warden, Gaia Sotharr, is young and idealistic, and she is locked in a power struggle with the lich of Halden’s Tomb. Neither seems to be able to get the upper hand in this struggle, and Gaia is too proud to call for help from her church. In fact, she has an unholy fascination with Gath—as long as he exists, her life has meaning and purpose, and after years of confl ict she would not happily see him destroyed, though she gladly kills his minions and allies. It seems clear that Gath has similar feelings, if he can be said to feel, or else Gaia would certainly not be alive.
