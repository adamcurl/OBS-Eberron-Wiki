## Bio
Councilor of Upper Tavick’s Landing and has been for thirty years, and largely views his ward as a separate city within the city. He has a reputation for stirring up conflict and setting the other councilors against one another.

He has strong connections to the Boromar Clans. He is a respected man who has always looked out for the interests of the wealthy of Tavick’s Landing, as well as for the Boromars. However, he has a secret: he is an agent of the Dreaming Dark. Fifteen years ago, the Inspired dominator Tirashana infected him with a mind seed, and today he is one of three Inspired moles. While appearing to promote the agendas of his supporters, he has actually been stirring up dissent and discord.
