## Bio
Although he swears allegiance to the fl ag of Karrnath, Madox Kaminarr believes that his nation should have pressed the war and fi nished off its enemies. When Kaius sued for peace, Madox lost respect for his king, although he still believes Kaius may be the greatest man alive (having no inkling that Kaius is, in fact, a vampire). Madox counts himself a student of history and knows the details of many great battles and commanders. He believes that the descendants of Karrn the Conqueror have an obligation to unite all of Khorvaire under one banner, but his solemn hope of a unified Khorvaire was dashed the day Kaius signed the Treaty of Thronehold.

Madox has no specifi c orders. He patrols Karrnath’s borders astride a skeletal heavy warhorse and travels with a retinue of dire wolf skeletons (which he controls). He occasionally makes forays into the Mournland, the Mror Holds, and the Talenta Plains. A few times each year, the bone knight visits family in Korth or pays his respects at the tombs of fallen Karrnathi knights in Rekkenmark.
