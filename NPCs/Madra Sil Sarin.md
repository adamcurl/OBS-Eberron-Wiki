## Description
- **Appearance:** A small figure appears out of thin air. At fi rst she seems to be a child wrapped in shifting shadows, but as you get a closer look you see that she is a gnome wearing a hooded darkweave cloak, her features hidden behind a darkweave scarf. She wears black studded leather beneath her cloak, and you catch the shimmer of steel as a dagger dances out of her hand and through the air.

## Bio
Madra is the deadliest assassin in the service of the Trust. She is a disturbing enigma even to the other gnomes; she answers only to the Trust, and she has killed quite a few gnomes to preserve the secrets of the embassy. Doran can use his telepathic bond to request her services, but only the Trust can approve an assassination. It is important to remember this: while she is one of the most dangerous women in Khorvaire, she only acts if she has direct orders from Zilargo. She does not use her skills lightly or squander them on personal vendettas.

Madra spends most of her time under cover of invisibility, silently watching the city and waiting for instructions. With her ring of sustenance and telepathic bonds, she rarely needs to verbally or physically interact with people (she uses prestidigitation to keep her clothing clean). She is often called out of Sharn to serve the Trust in other parts of Khorvaire—but it’s usually impossible to tell. And, of course, there may be any number of additional Zil assassins hidden in the embassy waiting to be activated—though it is unlikely that any possess the skills or equipment to match Madra
