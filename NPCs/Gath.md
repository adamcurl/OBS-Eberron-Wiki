## Description
- **Appearance:** A set of cruelly spiked full plate armor seems almost empty, as though little more than a skeleton were strapped inside. Bright pinpoints of blood-red light gleam inside the skull-shaped helmet. The figure hefts a black morningstar in its left hand, while its right hand seems to crackle with black energy.
