## Bio
Kurala d’Jorasco does a brisk business in Clifftop. In addition to possessing the Least Mark of Healing (lesser restoration), she is an adept of Boldrei and can perform magical healing for her clients, including remove curse and remove disease. While she runs her own business, Kurala is a respected member of House Jorasco and is often called in to help the healers in Dragon Towers. Kurala’s House includes three lesser healers—two 3rd-level adepts and a 4th-level expert with the Least Mark of Healing (cure light wounds)—and Kurala’s husband Janasar, who specializes in the care and treatment of animals.
