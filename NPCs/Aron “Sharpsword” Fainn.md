## Bio
Within the ranks of the King’s Dark Lanterns, Aron Fainn is known as Sharpsword. Abandoned as an infant and raised in orphanages until the age of fourteen, he took to living on the streets of Sharn as an adolescent. He slept in alleys and scrounged for crowns (copper coins) to buy food. He became a skilled cutpurse despite feeling sick at the thought of stealing other people’s money. Blessed with a strong sense of justice, he rescued a merchant from a changeling mugger and received a reward that kept him off the streets for a while. At age sixteen, he joined the army and marched east to fi ght in the Last War. His skill with the blade and his fi erce devotion to Breland caught the eye of a captain working for the King’s Citadel, and before long Aron was indoctrinated and assigned to the Dark Lanterns. Aron showed little interest in surveillance work, but he excelled at hunting down criminals, traitors, conspirators, and rogue agents. Although the world is painted in shades of gray, Aron tends to see things in black and white. Enemies still plot against the Brelish crown, and Aron has vowed to stop them. He rarely leaves the country and prefers to work alone. Although he has many likable qualities, Aron is ruthless and uncompromising in the pursuit of his mission.

Aron prefers to fi ght one-on-one and retreats if accosted by multiple foes.
