## Bio
Athiana runs Athania's Companions in Sharn.

The escorts of Athaniaâ€™s are women and men of beauty and intelligence, trained in the arts of conversation, seduction, and deception. After spending time with a client, they prepare an intelligence report for Athania, who fi nds interested buyers for any signifi cant items. Some secrets she keeps to herself, holding them in reserve to use as leverage when her cover is fi nally broken.
