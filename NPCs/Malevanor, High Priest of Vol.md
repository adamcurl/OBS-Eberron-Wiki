## Bio
Malevanor is the high priest in the Crimson Monastery, Karrnath’s largest Blood of Vol temple. He spends most of his time overseeing necromantic research and the construction of ever greater undead to serve the Blood of Vol and the Order of the Emerald Claw. He’s no great researcher himself, but his abilities to command both the living and the undead make him an effective taskmaster for the temple’s many necromantic acolytes.

In a fight, Malevanor tries to take out anyone paralyzed by the sight of him. Then he uses enervation on an enemy cleric or other spellcaster. After that, he wades into combat, hitting foes with spontaneous infl ict spells and mummy rot as part of his slam attack.
