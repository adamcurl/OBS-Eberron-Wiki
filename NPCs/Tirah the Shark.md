## Bio
Tirah is the quintessential Whiteroof half-elf; in the last century she’s been a smuggler, a legitimate merchant, an angler, and even a river privateer in Scions Sound. She’s now reached middle age for a half-elf, and she fi nally owns her own keelboat: Darandra’s Thrill. Accordingly, she’s a little more cautious about any dangerous or extralegal undertakings. She still undertakes them, of course, but she hems and haws about it first.

No one knows the Aundair River better than Tirah the Shark, and no one’s more adept at eluding the Aundairian revenue cutters—or bribing the ones she can’t outmaneuver. Tirah’s a good source for characters who want to slip into or out of Fairhaven surreptitiously. Darandra’s Thrill has been known to make pickups and dropoffs on deserted Thrane beaches as well.
