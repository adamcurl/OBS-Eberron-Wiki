## Bio
Belew leads the Sword Point Garrison in Sharn. Belew is a harsh but effective leader. He tries to curry favor with the Citadel, the dragon marked houses, the city council, and the temple leadership all at the same time. As a direct result, he commits most of his resources and attention to the Upper and Middle Central districts, leaving Lower Central under protected and Northedge practically ignored.
