## Bio
The Queen of Aundair, Aurala ir’Wynarn, is known for her eloquence. In fact, her enemies sometimes claim that she talked her way out of the Last War. When Aurala was younger, her suitors considered her attractive and charismatic, but they never realized how cautious and clever she was in playing them against each other—a talent she has cultivated ever since. (Her supporters attest she fi nally married for love, but some suspect her marriage to a noble from House Vadalis was really a political move.)

While Aurala willingly relinquishes some measure of power to lesser nobles in order to keep the wheels of government turning, she excels at asserting her authority at every opportunity. With fl owery words and a powerful presence, she rallies her most stalwart supporters with confi dence and ease.

Aurala powerfully and loudly proclaims the need to maintain the hard-fought peace, while secretly planning for the next stage of the war. Although she has put on a public show of backing away from confl ict, including withdrawing troops from the western border, she has given a handful of her nobles the authority to muster and maintain “small” defense forces that she can call upon whenever the nation is threatened.
