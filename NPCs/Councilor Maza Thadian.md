## Bio
Councilor of Upper Northedge. A venerable elf and owner of one of the finest restaurants in Sharn, the Oaks, she fights to maintain tradition but definitely puts the needs of the wealthy ahead of the poor. 

She is both very rich and very old, and as such is highly respected in Sharn's elven community. She is a major conservative voice in Sharn, working to uphold the status quo and tradition, and she tends to favor the wealthy over the poor. These tendencies are said to be especially strong in regards to those from the worst of the lower wards, and specifically goblins. Though a law abiding citizen for the most part, she is said to engage in subterfuge to defend her political ideals.
