## Bio
Prince Kaius is the third child and second son of King Jarot ir'Wynarn. Unknown to almost everyone, his death in 910 YK was faked and he later took the identity of his great-grandson, Kaius ir'Wynarn III.

Prince Kaius declared himself King of Karrnath in late 894 YK, soon after the start of what would come to be called the Last War.

During the Last War the residents of Karrnath were unable to support themselves with their own agriculture. With trade between the nations at a standstill, a terrible famine struck his nation. King Kaius was approached by members of the Blood of Vol who offered to help him and his people. While this deal brought much relief in the form of food, it also carried a heavy personal price. He was transformed into an undead creature - a vampire - in 897 YK by none other than Erandis Vol.

King Kaius never liked the alliance with the Blood of Vol, and in 910 YK relinquished the throne by faking his death in order to find a way to break the alliance. After over 80 years of working in secrecy, he returned to the throne under the guise of his descendant King Kaius III.

King Kaius has kept his true nature hidden from not only his country, but the world at large. While evil, King Kaius is one of the major proponents for peace in Khorvaire, possibly due to the fact that war has cost him so much in his life.

King Kaius III is a hard man to meet in person. He takes audiences only with those he trusts—and that’s a pretty short list. Mordenkainen’s private sanctum and dimensional lock spells cover his personal quarters. He doesn’t have many scheduled public appearances or offi cial ceremonies. If the PCs fi t into his plans, he deals with them through Regent Moranna.

Above all else, Kaius is a planner. He always has contingency plans—and then contingencies for his contingencies.

Another important aspect of Kaius is his utter ruthlessness. This is a man who’s been through a lot: He turned against his own sister, breaking a 900-year tradition of peaceful succession. He became a vampire to save his nation. He killed his own wife in vampiric bloodlust. He went into hiding for eighty years, then replaced his own great-grandson on the throne. He turned his granddaughter into a vampire, and he keeps a harem of young Karrns so he can drink their blood.
