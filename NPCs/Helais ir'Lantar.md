## Bio
Helais handles the deeper diplomacy and intrigue. Why? Because Helais is not simply an ambassador—he is one of the Royal Eyes of Aundair, a trusted agent who serves as Queen Aurala’s eyes and ears in Sharn.

But Queen Aurala has been betrayed, and her misplaced trust may spell disaster in the future. His role as master of spies is the least of Helais’s secrets. The dark truth is that there is only one ir’Lantar brother. The ir’Lantar family has served the Lords of Dust for many generations, and Helais ir’Lantar is actually a guise used by the two rakshasas of Sharn, Zathara and Nethatar.

Usually, one of the two rakshasa poses as Helais, while the other is disguised in a different form elsewhere in the city. However, as Alais and Helais are identical twins, this allows for a host of possibilities. If necessary, the two rakshasa can appear as Alais and Helais; at other times, Alais poses as his brother. Alais wears a ring of mind shielding and the Lords of Dust possess masks of the misplaced aura, so it is extremely difficult to pierce these deceptions.
