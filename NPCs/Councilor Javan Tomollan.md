## Bio
Javan made his money as a trade representative of House Lyrandar, but later separated from the house, and no longer has friendly contact with it. He is a shrewd and tough negotiator, but fair. Javan is of the view that dedication and effort ought to be rewarded. He focuses on advancing the interests of the Upper Central citizens, and has no concern for Lower Dura's poor.

Fellow councilor Sorik Sensos is an obsessive rival of Javan, being envious of his wealth and success. The Aurum makes active efforts to recruit Javan for their Platinum Concord, but without success. He lives at the Tomollan Estate in the Mithral Tower, and is the most notable resident there.
