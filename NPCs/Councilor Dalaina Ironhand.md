## Bio
A plain-spoken woman who represents the merchants of the district. She is a hard-nosed negotiator with no sense of humor and no interest in anything beyond the bottom line. She always drives for the best bargain for her people—whatever form that bargain may take—but she has no taste for underhanded intrigue. As a result, she opposes the schemes of the “Boromar Block”— [[Councilor Bestan ir’Tonn]], [[Councilor Caskar Halavik]], and [[Councilor Ilyra Boromar]] —whenever possible.
