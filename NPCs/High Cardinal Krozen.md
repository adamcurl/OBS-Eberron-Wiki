## Bio
In his youth, Krozen was an idealistic crusader. His single-minded dedication to the Silver Flame and willingness to stand behind his convictions earned him the position he holds today. Unfortunately, the power corrupted him, and now he treats Thrane like his own personal kingdom. Since the destruction of Cyre, however, Krozen has become unusually paranoid, conducting extensive correspondence in secret and seldom leaving Flamekeep. Claiming concern for his safety, he holds audiences with his peers only in private chambers, and only then after forcing courtiers to submit to elaborate security protocols. When Krozen does fi nally meet someone face to face, he is always armed, even if his visitors aren’t. Some suspect that he has fallen from grace. His caution, however, has not diminished his power. Despite all investigations, allegations of his misdeeds remain unproven. He is either a brilliant mastermind behind a conspiracy of evil in Thrane or a diversion for the genuine evils in his country. Until the truth is revealed, investigations continue.

A few zealous cardinals aspire to take Krozen’s place, so he must constantly deal with rivals. Most who cross him live to regret it.
