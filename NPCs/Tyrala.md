## Bio
The Cyran spymaster Tyrala is Jairan’s mirror image. She is obsessed with the survival of Cyre and will use any means necessary to achieve that goal, however questionable they may be. Jairan may ask a Cyran character to perform an altruistic deed; Tyrala’s requests are often morally ambiguous, though they may have more concrete results. Tyrala firmly believes that one of the other nations was behind the destruction of Cyre, and she is determined to fi nd out who did it and how, and to take a bitter vengeance. She uses this as a lever against a Cyran character—doesn’t he want revenge for the hundreds of thousands of his people who were killed? Doesn’t he want to prevent this from ever happening again? The embassy can draw on the discretionary funds held in the Kundarak Bank, but it has little to offer—its primary currency is loyalty to the lost nation.
