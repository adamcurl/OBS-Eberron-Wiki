## Summary
The Race of Eight Winds is a sporting event that takes place in the Dura quarter of Sharn on the 23rd day of Lharvion each year. Traditionally, the race features eight riders, each riding a flying beast representing a different area of the Dura quarter, competing on an aerial course through and around the spires of Sharn. The winner of the event receives a gold purse and some land, as well as glory for the area of the Dura quarter they represented. The race is a major cultural touchstone for the Dura quarter and brings in spectators from across Khorvaire.

According to a popular legend, King Galifar II founded the Race of Eight Winds by using Sharn to test the suitability of different flying creatures for use as aerial cavalry and scouts.

## Rules
1. The beasts may use any natural weapons that they possess
2. The riders may **not** use spells, psionic powers, dragonmarks, magic devices, or alchemical items. Anyone who breaks these rules is immediately disqualified and probably torn apart by an angry mob. The only weapon a rider can use is a light sporting crossbow.

## The Beasts
### The Eagle
**Region:** Broken Arch, Stormhold of Middle Dura
**Colors:** Brown & Gold
The districts of Broken Arch and Stormhold support the giant eagle, whose colors are brown and gold. Stormholders are especially passionate about the race, even though the eagle rarely wins. Many Stormholders take pride in being fierce and noble like the eagle, and they rarely participate in the politics and intrigue that often affect the final outcome of the race. They are especially dismissive of the other birds of Middle Dura; the hawk is a lesser eagle, while the owl is treacherous and far too clever.

### The Gargoyle
**Region:** Fallen, Malleon's Gate of Lower Dura
**Colors:** Black & Gray
Fallen and Malleon's Gate were originally represented by the dire bat. As immigrants from Droaam came to Sharn, most settled in the Cogs or Malleon's Gate. Twelve years ago, the region of the bat made an unprecedented change and shifted their regional beast to the gargoyle, whose colors are black and gray. Currently, the region is represented by Carralag (N male gargoyle rogue 4), a remarkably clever gargoyle with the Manifest Flight feat.

The people of Malleon's Gate are fiercely dedicated to the event. The violence appeals to the Darguuls, while the city goblins love the chance to compete against the elitist folk of the upper levels. While the gargoyle has yet to win the race, it has had greater success than the bat, and this has brought increased support for Daask and the Droaamites within the district.

### The Glidewing
**Region:** Gate of Gold, the Stores of Lower Dura
**Colors:** Gray & Green
This flying dinosaur represents the districts of Gate of Gold and the Stores, and its colors are gray and green. The glidewing is extremely popular among the halflings of Sharn, and some say that the Boromar Clan is the financial force behind the Glidewing Wind Guard.

### The Griffon
**Region:** Precarious, Oldkeep of Lower Dura
**Colors:** Brown & Red
This powerful beast represents Precarious and Oldkeep, and its colors are brown and red. During the race, red ribbons are usually tied to the forelegs of the griffon, giving the impression of streams of blood coming from its claws. The people of Precarious are fanatically (and often violently) devoted to the race, although many don't care if they win or lose; as long as the griffon brings down one of the other beasts, they consider it to be a victory.

### The Hawk
**Region:** Tumbledown, Underlook of Middle Dura
**Colors:** Light brown & Dark brown
Tumbledown and Underlook are represented by the dire hawk, whose colors are light brown and dark brown. The hawk rarely wins, but Underlook makes considerable profits off the tourist trade and most Tumbledowners are devoted followers of their underdog champion.

### The Hippogriff
**Region:** Daggerwatch, Overlook of Upper Dura
**Colors:** White & Gold
Daggerwatch and Overlook are represented by the hippogriff, whose colors are white and gold. The Goldwings (the aerial division of the Sharn Watch) are based in Daggerwatch, and a Goldwing officer typically represents the district in the race. The hippogriff has one of the best records in the race, rivaled only by the pegasus.

### The Owl
**Region:** Rattlestone, the Bazaar of Middle Dura
**Colors:** Brown & Gray
The giant owl is the beast of Rattlestone and the Bazaar, and its colors are brown and gray. While it is one of the slowest creatures in the race, the owl is famous for manipulating the outcome of the race with intrigue and diplomacy. While many of the inhabitants of Dura speak dismissively of "two-faced owls," the merchants, con artists, and pickpockets of the region take pride in their mascot's cunning, and a strong streak of carefree pragmatism runs through these districts. A few former racing owls are now merchants themselves, which can lead to unusual encounters in the Bazaar.

### The Pegasus
**Region:** Highwater of Upper Dura
**Colors:** White & Silver
Highwater was the last district to join the Race of Eight Winds. Thanks to House Vadalis, Highwater is represented by the pegasus, whose colors are white and silver. The pegasus is the swiftest creature in the race, and it has brought Highwater to victory time and again. The people of Highwater are proud folk and are always willing to discuss the ways in which a pegasus is superior to the other beasts. However, success has its price. The other districts often team up to bring down the pegasus at the start of the race. And outside of the race, many of the inhabitants of the lower wards despise the people of Highwater; thieves and bullies will go out of their way to target a snooty pegasus supporter.
