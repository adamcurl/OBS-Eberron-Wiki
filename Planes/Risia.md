# Risia: The Plain of Ice

   Risia is defined by endless arctic wastes, and what appear to be mountains are just peaks of solid ice. However, Risia is not just defined as being a cold and icy plane. By comparison, the core ideas that define Risia are isolation, stagnation, and preservation. The endless frozen plane isn’t about snow, it’s about the utter stillness, the empty and unchanging landscape. Risia is sparsely populated, because that’s the point of it; it’s bleak and lonely, a realm in which you could walk for days and never see another creature. Where a desert of sand can at least shift in the breeze, the frozen landscape of Risia is unchanging. Yet, unlike a stone plateau, it reflects a substance that could change at one point—but is now caught, frozen, stagnant. What ancient secrets and relics have been preserved in this plane?

## Effects


*   **Lethal Cold. **A creature exposed to the cold of Risia must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw every 10 minutes or gain one level of exhaustion. A creature with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeeds on this saving throw, as does a creature naturally adapted to cold climates or one wearing appropriate protective gear. In addition, all creatures have resistance to fire damage, and a creature that’s usually resistant to fire damage becomes immune to it.


*   **Empowered Ice. **When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, if it deals cold damage, it does so as if cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.


*   **Preservation.** A creature with 0 hit points becomes stable at the end of its turn, entering a state of suspended animation. If an unconscious creature remains in contact with the ground for more than 1 minute, it’s drawn below the surface and encased in an ice-encrusted stasis. While encased in this way, time ceases to flow for the creature and it doesn’t grow older.


*   **Stagnation. **When a creature finishes a long rest, it doesn’t regain hit points or reduce its exhaustion level. However, it does recover Hit Dice normally and can spend them to regain hit points.


*   **Stillness of Flesh. **Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers. However, the passage of time has no effect on a mortal creature’s body, and creatures don’t age or grow while in Risia. Exhaustion, starvation, and disease merely reduce a creature to 0 hit points, and don’t immediately kill it. Dwarves are immune to this property’s effects, and in Risia they can grow, age, and die, just as they would on the Material Plane. ^30e1a0

## Denizens


*   **Spirits of Ice**

    *   At first glance, Risia appears to be barren and empty. But some travelers have described a presence, a sense of being watched, and most feel this presence is malign. On the surface, the concept of Risia seems entirely neutral; there’s nothing inherently evil about ice. But there’s a hunger to Risia—an innate desire to consume warmth and to bury living things in ice. This is called the Killing Cold
    *   These include bheur hags, frost salamanders, ice devils, chain devils, and the Lonely (sorrowsworn). These are spirits of the Killing Cold, of bitter isolation, and of the ice that entombs and preserves. When these manifestations aren’t active, they’re absorbed into their layer; they manifest when they’re needed, in the form that’s needed. 



*   **Frost Giants and Dwarves**

    *   The Group of Eleven was an alliance of empyreans of tremendous skill and power. Each studied a different plane (leaving Fernia to the Sulat League and Dal Quor to the Cul’sir). The archarcanist Il’Ara was devoted to Risia, and she magebred her own lineage of frost giants over millennia. When the forces of Argonnessen began to lay waste to Xen’drik, Il’Ara gathered her faithful children and passed through to Risia, certain that they could find sanctuary in the isolation of the Plain of Ice.
    *   Il’Ara’s children have since established themselves across the layers of Risia. There are a few citadels where multiple giants live together, while others have established their own solitary outposts. Each has found a different path to surviving the endless tedium of immortality in the icy wastes. Some have become artists, writing poetry or sculpting massive works of art that take centuries to complete. Others pursue physical diversions such as wrestling, hunting fiends, or crafting ornate games. These denizens always take great interest in outsiders as a source of diversion. The crueler giants take joy in hunting newcomers, but others can be excellent hosts. 
    *   The frost giants of Risia have dwarf servants. Their origin is a mystery: the giants know that Il’Ara produced these first dwarves, but they don’t know—or at least remember—if she created them herself or pulled them through from Eberron. These dwarves know no other existence than their servitude to their giant masters, and Risia holds few other options for them. 
    *   **Il’Ara **continues her arcane studies in her fortress, Winter. She may have found ways to wield vast power over Risia and to protect her children from the fiends . . . or she could be bored of her immortal existence, considering entering the ice and embracing stasis


## Layers


*   **Frostmantle**

    *   This seemingly endless range of mountains, formed of solid ice, is surrounded by a sea of dense mist. Frostmantle is the primary home of the frost giants of Il’Ara, who have carved citadels from the ice of the mountains. The three largest fortresses are called Freehearth, Remorse, and Winter. Remorse holds many giants who have chosen to enter icy stasis out of eternal boredom, while Winter is the abode of Il’Ara herself. Numerous smaller keeps are spread across the peaks, the abodes of individual giants. Clouds hide the sky above Frostmantle, but the light is steady and unchanging; night never falls here. Travelers must deal with the effects of high altitude as well as the lethal cold.



*   **The Boundless Blizzard**

    *   Chill winds howl as snow and hail fill the air. Explorers may find themselves on an icy plateau or in a mountain pass; with the vicious storm, visibility is limited to 60 feet, so there’s no knowing what lies ahead. Adventurers may find an occasional cave or other shelter, but it’s always possible that it’s already occupied by a remorhaz or other stranded monstrosity. The raging storm of the Boundless Blizzard never ends, and adventurers face high winds and lethal cold. The layer is permanently caught between night and day; due to the storm, the light is dim at best, and areas of intense snow may be heavily obscured.


*   **The Frozen Sea**

    *   Imagine an ocean frozen in a single instant. There’s no sign of any shore, just waves caught mid-crest alongside the frozen funnels of maelstroms. And scattered across the realm, there are countless ships—vessels pulled from the oceans of Eberron in moments when the moons were right and Risia was coterminous. Some are shattered or wrecked, caught halfway through the process of sinking. Others are in perfect condition, frozen under the thinnest layer of ice. It’s always night on the Frozen Sea; the moon Dravago is fixed in the cloudless sky, shedding dim light on the water.


## Coterminous and Remote


   Traditionally, Risia becomes coterminous once every five years for the full month of Zarantyr. Once every five years, exactly two and a half years after it is coterminous, it’s remote during the month of Lharvion. However, this isn’t always the case. Historians have recorded times when the cycle has extended far longer; in 657 YK, Risia entered a coterminous phase that lasted for three years.


   **Coterminous:** Temperatures drop sharply, and areas that would normally be chilly but otherwise safe can take on the Lethal Cold, Empowered Ice, and Stillness of Flesh universal properties. During these times, on rare occasions, creatures caught in an area of exceptionally intense cold can be unexpectedly transported to Risia. 


   **Remote: **Intense cold loses some of its bite. Creatures have advantage on saving throws made against the effects of extreme cold and on saving throws against spells that deal cold damage.


## Valuable Items


*   **Risian ice** is extremely rare, vivid blue, and charged with the essence of the plane. This ice maintains its temperature under any conditions and never melts, even on the Material Plane. An object carved from Risian ice can be used as a spellcasting focus for spells related to ice or water, and it’s a powerful component for creating magical effects related to cold or stasis. 


*   **Ancient artifacts. **The frost giants possess magic items and artifacts that they brought with them from Xen’drik, and Il’Ara has surely created new wonders over the years. Adventurers could also find treasures from any civilization there, either buried in the Frozen Sea or still clutched in the hands of people entombed within the ice.
