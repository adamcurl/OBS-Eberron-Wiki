# Kythri: The Churning Chaos


   It’s hard to keep a consistent rhythm in Kythri. It takes effort to maintain any pattern of behavior; without even thinking about it, people in Kythri adjust their behavior to avoid repetition. This is the essence of Kythri. On the one hand it’s a vision of chaos, but it’s also about change, adapting to overcome the unexpected, and challenging traditions.


   Kythri is commonly imagined as utterly unstable, with landscapes taking shape only to boil away within moments. And this is true of the heart of the realm, known as the Sea of Chaos. But at the edges of the sea, there are islands that linger. The environments of these Shifting Islands steadily and constantly change; a vast desert might be a lush rainforest in a few hours. But the land itself remains constant, made of natural material, and creatures can live on these islands, adapting to the endlessly changing environment.

## Effects

*   **Broken Rhythms.** A creature can’t take the exact same action on two consecutive turns. If it previously stood still, it must move. If it previously moved, it can stand still or move a different distance. A creature can cast a spell in two consecutive turns, but it can’t be the same spell. A creature can attack on two consecutive turns, but the second attack must be described as substantially different in style from the one before.


*   **Fluid in Form.** When a creature casts a transmutation spell, its range is doubled; if it has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is doubled.


*   **Embrace the Unknown.** In order to cast a divination spell of 1st level or higher, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 12 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost. Divination spells cast on other planes can’t affect or target creatures, places, or objects on Kythri.


*   **The Odds Are Odd.** If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1 or a 2, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 19 or 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC, and is considered a critical hit. If a creature has an ability or item that increases its normal range of critical hits—such as the Champion fighter’s Improved Critical—its range increases by 1.


*   **Constant Change.** Nothing remains exactly the same in Kythri. Whenever a creature finishes a short or long rest, it finds that something changed about it or its possessions. Each player should describe what’s changed about their character; this could be as simple as your cloak changing color or your sword now having a stylish Aundairian design when it was originally Karrnathi. You could choose for the change to be physical—your skin, hairstyle, or sex—or mental—you suddenly hate olives or no longer believe in the Sovereign Host. These changes have no mechanical impact: the coins in your pocket may change in design, but copper coins won’t turn into platinum. If you want a change to have mechanical impact—for example, if your cleric’s faith or race changes and you want your character sheet to reflect that—discuss the possibility with your DM.


*   **Chaotic Time. **Time is fluid in Kythri, inconsistent both with the Material Plane and within its own islands. Adventurers who spend a day in Kythri could find that a year has passed in Eberron, or they could be trapped in Kythri for a year and find that only an hour has passed when they return.

## Denizens



*   **Wild Things**


    *   The wild things of Kythri are mortal creatures. They live, reproduce, and die following (mostly) natural means, and have to find sustenance and shelter in their islands. If one species dies out, though, more will evolve to take their place. These things are mostly beast creatures, with no alien-like creatures among them.
    *   Kythri’s islands include some creatures that appear to be natural beasts, though they change as the region around them does; the wolf in the forest becomes an arctic wolf when the land turns into a glacier, and turns into a jackal when it’s a desert. Even beyond their practical changes for survival, Kythrian creatures might be constantly shifting their plumage, behavior, and more fundamental biology, whether from moment to moment or day to day.
    *   Kythri is home to many creatures that blend the features of two or more natural beasts: monstrosities such as the owlbear, griffon, and chimera. Some speculate that Kythri is the birthplace of these creatures.
    *   The wild things of Kythri also include natural shapechangers, notably a wide variety of mimics—even colossal ones that can assume the shape of natural features such as hills or mountains.



*   **Slaadi**

    *   The slaadi are native immortals of Kythri. Though they do reproduce (in strange and disturbing ways) and can die of mortal ailments, they’re defined as immortals because their population remains constant. Whenever a new slaad is born—whatever the method of its creation—an existing slaad dies, seemingly at random. And whenever a slaad is killed, a new one is formed. So while they seem to share many of the traits of mortals, they can never be wiped out even if they die en masse, and even if a blue slaad transforms a village of humans into slaadi with the chaos phage, the overall number of slaadi doesn’t increase.
    *   They aren’t a monolithic society; some live in massive cities, while others are tiny rustic communities. Each slaad community has its own distinct culture and a grand name, and each one might change physical places. These changes are astonishingly fast, but they aren’t instant; there are usually at least a few days of chaotic transition and revolution in between a change. The scope of a community won’t change—Cornerstone is always a metropolis, while Turn is always a village—but the structures of the community shift. 
    *   The slaadi themselves retain their core forms while their buildings and government change. Red slaadi are always red toad-like creatures that implant eggs, but the Lyceum slaadi might be tall and slender, while the Concordance slaadi are squat and heavy. Kythri’s influence can also cause slaadi to change color. So slaadi follow standard methods for creating particular colors—a blue slaad infects creatures with chaos phage, creating red or green slaadi—but a green slaad could go to sleep one night and wake up as a death slaad, and vice versa. In a culture like the Concordance, that means leadership frequently changes, because it’s based on color, not personality
    *   Because slaad cultures change so rapidly, they rarely enact plans beyond their own communities, though cities occasionally clash. Some weeks they seek to exterminate the githzerai, and other weeks, to ally with them. You never know what you’ll get.
    *   **The Grand Concordance of Iron** is a ruthless regime that intends to subjugate all slaadi, and then, the entire multiverse. It’s a strict caste system in which the death slaadi are cruel tyrants and all slaadi serve in the military.
    *   **The Enlightened Lyceum League** is a democratic society of scholars and philosophers. They believe in finding a peaceful solution to every problem and a logical answer to every question.
    *   **The Final Regency** asserts that the Sovereigns have abandoned reality and ordered the slaadi of the Regency to rule the multiverse in their stead until they return. They are fanatically devoted to a slaad-based version of the Sovereign Host and are offended by all inaccurate representations.
    *   **The Glorious Union of Flesh** asserts that slaadi are the ultimate evolution of life and seek to grant all other humanoids the gift of slaadhood through the chaos phage. They don’t accept the idea that slaad numbers will always remain constant; clearly previous slaad cultures just weren’t doing it properly.
    *   **The Confluence of Reality** believes that every civilization has something worth emulating, and studies other cultures to find these things. In a Confluence community, you could find slaadi eating Aundairian crepes, playing an Aereni form of Conqueror, and debating the finer points of Daanvi law.
    *   **The Republic of B’ob** is ruled by a red slaad who makes up new laws whenever he feels like it. Why is B’ob in charge? Well, that was the first rule he made, and the only one he hasn’t changed. And he’s B’ob! Who else would be in charge?

*   **Githzerai**

    *   The githzerai aren’t natives of Kythri, and their presence is an act of defiance: through unparalleled mental discipline, they create bastions of order in the heart of chaos. They seek to strengthen their will by imposing it on a reality that absolutely defies it.
    *   The githzerai don’t dwell on the Shifting Islands of Kythri. Instead, they’ve created their own islands in the Sea of Chaos: vast monastery vessels the size of small towns, moving through the eddies of chaos and defying transformation. The githzerai devote themselves to meditation and self-improvement, with little interest in what transpires beyond their monasteries. They have no particular love of outsiders—they consider all creatures of Eberron to be warped shadows of their stolen reality—but neither are they inherently hostile. A persuasive group of adventurers could find brief shelter in a githzerai monastery, especially if they bring something interesting to trade or have compelling stories to share. However, should the outsiders offend the githzerai, they’ll feel no remorse in eliminating them; there’s nothing evil in shining light to dispel a shadow.



*   **Greater Powers?**

    *   No one knows if there’s a greater power shaping Kythri. The death slaadi are powerful beings, but there’s no known equivalent to Dolurrh’s Queen of the Dead or Dal Quor’s il-Lashtavar. Some sages assert that there must be a consciousness at the heart of the Sea of Chaos, a sentience behind the chaos, but if so, its presence has never been proven.


## Layers


   Unlike many planes, Kythri isn’t divided into layers. Its structure has a planar core, with islands of reality suspended within the Sea of Chaos. The closer you get to the heart of the sea, the more tumultuous it becomes. There are many slaad communities spread across the Shifting Islands, and at least half a dozen githzerai monastery vessels in the Sea of Chaos. 



*   **The Sea of Chaos**

    *   Space has little meaning in the Sea of Chaos. Matter, distance, and gravity are in constant flux. Lands and creatures appear and dissolve within moments. There are waves of lightning, streams of lava, and hurricane winds constantly shifting direction. A thousand foot-long dragon turtle might appear, try to swallow travelers, then become an island.
    *   Travel through the Sea of Chaos is driven by pure will. Travelers must impose the concept of motion and distance on the environment using great mental focus, while also protecting their vessel from both the destructive forces and from being transformed. Without a set location in mind, travelers will end up on a random Shifting Island.



*   **The Shifting Islands**

    *   There are countless islands on the edge of the Sea of Chaos, varying dramatically in size, each with its own environment. These are constantly changing, but they change slowly; it can take anywhere from a day to a week for an island to shift from a barren desert to a verdant jungle. Weather is generally more dynamic, and often at odds with the environment; a vast desert can suddenly face a dramatic blizzard.
    *   The primary denizens of the Shifting Islands are monstrosities and beasts that blend the features of multiple creatures. Populations expand and contract, and don’t have to be sustainable, so adventurers could find a plateau filled with griffons, or a realm of chimeras where each one has a different arrangement of heads. The intelligent inhabitants of the island are almost entirely slaadi.



*   **Cornerstone**

    *   Cornerstone is the largest of the slaad cities. Its architectural style and precise layout are constantly changing, but it’s always a sprawling city that houses hundreds of thousands of slaadi. If Cornerstone is held by the Concordance of Iron, it has vast armies drilling (though their tactics and units constantly shift). If it’s under the influence of the Final Regency, there are immense temples and countless shrines to the slaadi interpretation of the Sovereigns. 



*   **Zertherun IV**

    *   Zertherun IV is one of the monastery vessels of the githzerai. It’s under the guidance of the Serene Azera, whose mental discipline maintains the stability of the ship. The Alazerth Elemon is a senior monk charged with dealing with outsiders, which is sometimes a matter of diplomatic negotiations, and other times, rallying zerths to defend the vessel from attack. Like most githzerai, Elemon isn’t inherently hostile toward outsiders, but has no great love for them; his reaction is based entirely on the actions and approach of the visitors.
    *   Kythri’s Broken Rhythms and The Odds Are Odd properties don’t apply in a githzerai monastery, and while Constant Change exists, its effects are minimized. Zertherun IV maintains capacitors for change, such as gardens of small stones and engraved wheels with shifting patterns, which absorb the energies of change and prevent it from transforming the vessel.


## Coterminous and Remote


   Kythri’s cycle of coterminous and remote periods is completely unpredictable, lasting anywhere from days to centuries. Curiously, its proximity to Eberron has no discernable effects.


## Valuable Items



*   **Shiftweave Fibers **are harvested from plants in Kythrian zones to make shiftweave.


*   **Random magical items** sometimes appear. These can be normal items, but with a small twist that adds some random effect.
