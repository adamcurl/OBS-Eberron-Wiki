# Khyber Demiplanes

## Hearts

Each overlord is bound to and reincarnated in a particular demiplane within Khyber—the heart of an overlord. This is one reason the overlords can’t be permanently destroyed; each is part of the architecture of Khyber itself, and the overlord’s form that can be encountered in Eberron is simply a projection of its essence. To defeat the overlords, the champions of the Age of Demons used the Silver Flame to bind their immortal essence, preventing them from returning to their heart demiplane to reform. This essentially severed the brain from the heart—but the heart demiplanes still exist. The lesser servants of the overlord—its rakshasa and other fiend minions—return to the heart when they reform, and should an overlord’s bonds be broken, it will recover its full strength in its heart realm.

Heart demiplanes are relatively small, around the size of a large city. Each reflects the overlord it’s tied to in appearance and properties. Just as the shard-prison of an overlord’s spirit can affect a region, portals to a heart realm often affect the surrounding area; what’s believed to be a manifest zone to Shavarath might instead be a portal to the Bitter Shield. While the overlords aren’t consciously present in their hearts, their essences still permeate them. Heart realms are typically inhabited by a host of lesser fiends bound to that overlord. Many have no desire to return to Eberron until their overlords are free, while others serve in the Lords of Dust, using the heart as a refuge.

*   **The Bitter Shield: Rak Tulkhesh**
    *   A crimson fortress, with stones soaked in blood and walls studded with rusted iron spikes. Around the tower’s base, rakshasas and other fiends endlessly battle, their pointless struggle reflecting the bloodlust of their master. Mordakhesh the Shadowsword often returns to the Bitter Shield between schemes, and is hailed as lord of the fortress.

*   **The Tower of Shadows: Sul Khatesh**
    *    A tower built from black stone traced with silver. It glitters in the light of three unfamiliar crescent moons. Here, it’s always night, and the servants of the Keeper of Secrets sing paeans to the moons as they perform bloody sacrifices and trace eldritch symbols in the soil. The tower holds a library of dark secrets, and beside it, a scriptorium where fiends scribe the books of shadows that may be given to mortal warlocks. Beneath the city of Ashtakala in the Demon Wastes lies a portal to the Tower of Shadows, and the rakshasa Hektula dwells here when she’s not tending to the library of Ashtakala.

## Prisons

The most infamous prisoners of Khyber are the daelkyr, but there may well be others—either immortal spirits or mortal creatures that were trapped in the demiplane by their enemies. In the case of the daelkyr demiplanes, the daelkyr can’t leave them, but other creatures can freely enter or depart. So Dyrrn’s minions can swarm out of the Palace of Sinew, but as long as the Gatekeepers’ seals remain intact, Dyrrn itself cannot leave. The nature of the binding and the power of the daelkyr is such that they have shaped their demiplanes in their image, but lesser creatures could be trapped in more traditional prisons.

*   ** Palace of Sinew**
    *   **Description: **A palace made from bones and violet, breathing flesh
    *   **Prisoner: **Dyrrn the Corruptor
    *   **Material Plane Location: **Eldeen Reaches, Mror Holds
  
*   **Citadel of Lidless Eyes**
    *   **Description: **A citadel of molten stone, chiten, and flesh covered in eyes. Anyone who sits in Belashyrra’s throne can see through the eyes of any creature in Eberron or Khyber
    *   **Prisoner: **Belashyrra the Lord of Eyes
    *   **Material Plane Location: **Shadow Marches, Xen’drik

*   **Deepest Hive**
	*   **Description:** A large hive of giant insects of every kind with a complex tunnel system that sometimes breaches the surface world. The upper tunnels of Valaara’s realm are usually formed of fused glass-like material, then as explorers delve deeper, they find the walls formed of chitin and muscle, with insects swarming across every surface. One might discover pulsing cocoons, nests of slumbering purple worms, or chambers lined with thousands of glowing eggs. And in the heart is the Deepest Hive itself, where Valaara weaves its webs and conducts its sinister experiments
    *   **Prisoner: **Valaara the Crawling Queen
    *   **Material Plane Location:** Valaara's tunnels can form anywhere in the surface world. A 5 minute trip down a tunnel could bring you to the other side of Eberron.

*   **Castle of Stone**
    *   **Description: **A stone castle with glowing green mist seeping from the cracks
    *   **Prisoner: **Orlassk the Master of Stone
    *   **Material Plane Location: **Inside the belly of a Huge gargoyle roaming around Khyber


## Shadow

Unlike heart and prison demiplanes, shadow demiplanes serve no clear purpose. They aren’t prisons or fortresses of evil, but rather, strange reflections of the world. Much like Xoriat, they often defy natural logic—and this often gives them great value. Many sages call these “shadow demiplanes” because many seem to be shadows of other planes. But in fact, demiplanes of Khyber have no ties to the other planes, nor are they touched by the natural influence of Eberron or the celestial light of Siberys. Perhaps the concepts woven into these demiplanes are echoes of Khyber’s dreams or hints of what might have been . . . or perhaps their resemblance is inexplicable coincidence.

Shadow realms may hold important resources that can be used or harvested—but these regions always have a malevolent aspect. Fiends are common, and even mortal creatures that dwell there are sinister. Remaining in a shadow realm for too long is usually an invitation to corruption.

*   **The Abyssal Forest of Khaar**
    *   A primeval forest teeming with vines, blood, and carnivorous, cruel monstrosities. The strange plants can be used to create hardy potions or deadly poisons. 
    *   **Effects:**
        *   Any creature that’s not naturally immune to poison damage becomes vulnerable to poison damage, and it has disadvantage on saving throws against poison. 
*   **The Ironlands**
    *   The entire landscape is made out of metal.  Adamantine trees grow razor-sharp leaves, and iron blades of grass cut through soft shoes. Devils and demons engage in their own endless wars. These fiends enjoy fighting and oppressing mortals, but fortunately, they can’t leave their realm. The Ghaash’kala orcs of the Demon Wastes raid the Ironlands, pillaging weapons from the warrior fiends. The Kech Shaarat have expanded their deep vault into the Ironlands; over many centuries, these dar have established an alliance with one of the devil clans, allowing them to hold onto this territory. 
    *   **Effects:**
        *   [[Shavarath#^6d7f68|Shavarath’s Bloodletting]]
*   **The Vale of the Inner Sun**
    *   A valley of an ever-setting, prismatic sun. As a price for immortality in this demiplane, creatures who dwell in the Vale for an extended time become slowly mutated, eventually turning into unique aberrations. The inhabitants of the Vale—some of whom have been there for centuries—have no love of outsiders, and visitors must prove their worth to bathe in the prismatic light of the Inner Sun.
