# Fernia: The Sea of Flame


## Moon: Eyre

   The plane is filled with magma and flame, from massive volcanoes to cities eternally on the verge of being consumed by fire. But Fernia isn’t about mundane fire, it is about all the things we see in the flame, all the ideas it represents. It has layers reflecting wild destruction, where verdant forests eternally burn. It incorporates industry, with legions of azers forever toiling over fire and forge. And it reflects wild passion, burning emotions that can’t be held in, and glorious spectacle; these are the realm of the efreet, the lords of the Sea of Flame, forever striving to outshine their rivals.


   The azers stand between earth and flame, harvesting the ore they feed to their hungry forges. And in the deep caverns, the dao polish jewels and admire their treasures. Even in these deep layers, the air sears the lungs of creatures that lack the proper protection.


## Effects


*   **Deadly Heat. **All regions of Fernia are subject to extreme heat (as defined in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). In some areas of particularly deadly heat, a creature without protection must make a Constitution saving throw every minute instead of every hour. In addition, all creatures gain resistance to cold damage, and a creature that is usually resistant to cold damage becomes immune to it.


*   **Empowered Fire.** When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, if it deals fire damage, it does so as if cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.


*   **Fires of Industry.** A creature has advantage on ability checks using tools (such as baking with cook’s utensils, or forging an item with smith’s tools) when it incorporates Fernian flame into its action in place of mundane flame.


*   **Burning Bright.** Whenever a creature makes a death saving throw, it must make an additional saving throw, keeping the results of both rolls. In addition, when a creature gains a level of exhaustion, it gains an extra level; when it reduces a level of exhaustion, it reduces it by an additional level. In Fernia, whether you live or die, it’s going to happen quickly!


*   **Standard Time. **Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.

## Denizens

*   **Efreet**


    *   The Efreet are aristocrats, dwelling in sprawling mansions and castles, attended by countless servants, dwelling amidst astonishing opulence. Fire consumes, and the efreet are masters of conspicuous consumption. They are passionate and wild, quick to both anger and joy. They are casually cruel, and can consume or destroy the lives of others even as they celebrate. However, the efreet aren’t conquerors, for they already have everything they could possibly want; their elemental servants exist to serve them, and the efreet consider them to be casually disposable.
    *   The efreet have been competing with one another since the dawn of time. Passionate arguments can lead to an epic duel or even a large scale war. Most of the time, however, these competitions are merely social with each efreet trying to outshine the other through art, parties or grandiose displays. Each party needs to be better than the last and better than the competition’s. An efreet usually utilizes material in his/her native plane for this, but oftentimes, he/she will hire help from outsiders.
    *   **Sultan Azhalar of High Hearth** stands at the top of the social order. He has assembled the grandest armies and enjoys displays of martial might, including exotic engines of war. His galas often involve gladiatorial matches or grand war games.
    *   **Pasha Shashraqa of Firefall** stands just below Ashalar in the social order and is determined to unseat her rival. She is cultivating the friendship of several dragons. She considers herself to be a connoisseur of art, and could take an interest in the work of an artistic adventurer.
    *   **Pasha Raqashtar of Gold Ash** is the most cosmopolitan of the efreet. He has many friends in the Immeasurable Market of Syrania, and enjoys betting on the outcome of battles in Shavarath. His appetite for gambling could draw the adventurers into his orbit, as he might make a wager with another immortal about the outcome of a particular adventure—then seek to put a burning finger on the scales.

*   **Dao**

    *   The dao pluck wondrous jewels and pure adamantine from the primal earth, and it’s they who craft the grandest and most remarkable wonders. Each dao has a particular specialty, a unique style of art or artifice. While they can craft artifacts that would be the envy of any mortal artificer, their techniques can’t be easily replicated. Their work has an element of arcane science, but much of what they do involves channeling the essence of Fernia itself; a dao who settles in the Material Plane will find its talents more limited.
    *   The dao are more stoic than the fiery efreet, and don’t throw extravagant parties. But they still engage in intense social competition with one another, striving to craft the most glorious creations.  The dao don’t need gold, so the efreet usually pay them in barter, which creates a bizarre secondary market. 
    *   **Naja Ash **sculpts fire, producing masterful artifacts and tools that channel or produce flame. She creates the majority of the azer, and she can create other elemental creatures, constructs, or unique blends between the two concepts. She’s the foremost expert on elemental binding in the multiverse, though it would take a great deal to convince her to share her knowledge with mortals.
    *   **Sar Saeran** creates tools of war, from personal armor and weapons to grand siege engines. The efreeti Azhalar is his best client, but all of the efreet value his peerless work. He has spent eons trying to create the perfect sword, and often seeks out legendary blades on the Material Plane— sometimes to keep, sometimes to study for a few minutes, and sometimes to destroy.
    *   **Brass **is the finest architect of the dao, and is responsible for most of the grand palaces of the efreet. She’s always intrigued by unusual architecture and has visited Sharn a few times to study the towers. She’s also celebrated for her sculptures, and has produced everything from tiny miniatures to towering colossuses, along with magical marvels that begin as the former, then transform into something far larger, like figurines of wondrous power.



*   **Lesser Elementals**


    *   The raw fire and earth elementals that dwell in Fernia are driven by pure instinct and are primarily ignored by the efreet and dao, with the efreet ruling over them. Most lesser elementals are content as long as they have the opportunity to pursue their purpose, but occasionally a lesser elemental unexpectedly develops a quirk that drives it to pursue a new purpose.
    *   The population of these elementals is limited, and thus their service is valuable to the efreet and dao. The efreet and dao often barter the service of their elemental subjects, sending them to allied or rival courts. Typically this doesn’t matter to the elementals, but there have been a few cases of salamanders rebelling against a new lord or mephits playing tricks on their new comrades.
    *   **Azers. **The dao craft azers from bronze and bring them to life using the primordial spark of Fernia. They are tireless laborers who love working with fire and metals. Dao may create the greatest wonders, but the azers do remarkable work—and far more of it. Azer are naturally gifted artisans, and can be assigned to any sort of task that involves fire. However, there are few things more miserable than an azer baking bread instead of working with brass.
    *   **Mephits.** When encountered in the wilds, mephits are capricious tricksters and their “pranks” can make life miserable for planar travelers. However, those found in the service of the efreet are generally more polite and well mannered—though this can quickly change if there’s an opportunity for mischief too good to pass up.
    *   **Salamanders.** The primary servants of the efreet, salamanders can be found serving as soldiers or performing domestic tasks. For every salamander officer carrying an ornate spear, there’s a salamander butler carrying a brass tray. Salamanders are extremely proud, and within their ranks there is great competition over rank and position. Most are dismissive of mortals, but they can be jealous of adventurers who receive too much attention or favor.



*   **Fiends and Celestials**


    *   The fiends and celestials of Fernia embody specific aspects of the concept of fire. Fire is an integral part of their appearance; they may have burning eyes, orange-red skin, or wings and halos formed of flame.
    *   **Angels **represent the comfort fire offers: its life-giving warmth, the light that holds back the shadows. The angels of Fernia are typically devas or other lesser angels, and they generally seek to assist and comfort travelers when they can.
    *   **Demons **reflect the terrifying destructive power of fire, the wildfire that can’t be contained and the spark that brings down a mansion. They are wild and violent and yearn to burn all wondrous things. Common demons include quasits, vrocks with burning wings, and terrifying balors.
    *   **Devils **represent the intentional use of fire as a weapon or to inspire fear—the burning iron used in torture, the screams of those dying on burning battlefields. Devils are rare and exceptionally cruel. They thrive both on causing pain and suffering in Fernia, and cajoling mortals into acts of arson or fiery torture in the Material Plane.


## Layers


   Fernia is dominated by the vast layer known as the Sea of Flame. Where the sky can be seen, it’s almost always obscured by ash and smoke. Its smaller layers embody specific concepts, such as infernos and campfires. These can usually be reached through burning circles on the islands in the Sea of Fire, or via tunnels in the Deep Halls.



*   **The Sea of Fire**


    *   This is a seemingly endless ocean of magma, larger than any single sea in Eberron. Ultimately, the Sea of Fire wraps around on itself; head north from High Hearth and you’ll eventually find it again, but it may take a month of travel. There are islands in the sea, spires and mesas of basalt and obsidian—some are inhabited, but many are barren and empty.
    *   Salamanders sail the blazing sea in ships forged from blackened steel, and azers fly over it in balloons woven from brass. Many of the islands hold teleportation circles traced in continual flame, with a word inscribed in Ignan indicating the destination. Any spellcaster with proficiency in Arcana can expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to activate a portal— though unless they speak Ignan, they won’t know where it leads.
    *   **The City of Brass. **The sole metropolis in Fernia, the City of Brass is the glorious city of the efreet, a place of marvels. Here, a towering statue of an efreeti holds a sphere of continual flame the size of an airship. The statue reshapes itself to match the appearance of the efreeti who currently dominates society; both the statue and whichever efreeti it depicts are known as the Sultan.  
    
		All efreet have mansions in the City of Brass, though at any given time, many dwell within their island estates. Likewise, there are always a few dao in residence showing off their latest creations and taking new commissions. The streets are filled with mephits and salamanders. Visiting mortals are a curiosity, but most elementals are too busy to take much time on them. The City of Brass is ringed with teleportation circles, linking it to all of the estates and major foundries.
    *   **Efreeti Estates.** Each of the noble efreet have a sprawling palace or mansion on an island in the Sea of Fire. While not so grand as the City of Brass, these estates are studies in opulence, filled with dao-crafted wonders and sculptures of metal and flame.
    *   **Foundries.** Foundry islands are models of industry. Some are focused primarily on physical engineering, with vast gears and wheels slowly turning, and chains rising and falling. Others reflect arcane industry, with blazing glyphs and fields of shimmering energy. Here the azers work at all hours, producing both mundane, martial, and magical goods for the efreet and their servants
    *   **Deep Halls. **Under the foundries, tunnels extend down below the Sea of Fire into the earth below. These are the domains of the dao. Like the foundries above them, each has a distinct style tied to the sensibilities of the dao who dwells there. Streams of lava and pools of fire run through the halls, along with veins of metal and minerals. While not as luxurious as the estates of the efreeti, these often showcase the wondrous creations of the dao in residence; adventurers could find a hall whose walls are decorated with a thousand swords, or a brass garden filled with cunning construct songbirds. But some dao are paranoid, and deep halls can also contain a host of powerful and deadly traps.



*   **Infernos**


    *   Infernos are isolated layers that showcase a particular act of destruction by fire. One inferno is a burning city, where devils direct bombardment and demons dance about, spreading the flames within. In another layer, a lone balor oversees the devastation of an ancient forest. These fires never end; parts of the layer are rebuilt even as others are consumed, and the inferno continues forever.



*   **Campfires**


    *   These small layers reflect the comfort fire can offer. A campfire layer can be a literal campfire, a lonely light out in the darkest wilderness. Another campfire layer is an inn called the First Hearth, where the angelic barkeep Ashe offers warm drinks around the fireplace from which the inn takes its name. Campfire layers are safe havens, and a perfect place for travelers to rest.


## Coterminous and Remote


   Traditionally, Fernia is coterminous once every five years during the month of Lharvion, and it’s remote once every five years during the month of Zarantyr (exactly two and a half years after it’s coterminous).


   **Coterminous: ** temperatures rise sharply, and warmer regions that would normally be safe can become extremely hot, taking on the Deadly Heat, Empowered Fire, and Burning Bright properties of the plane. During these times, on rare occasions, creatures caught in an area of exceptionally intense flame can find themselves pulled through to Fernia itself


   **Remote:** intense heat loses some of its bite. Creatures have advantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of extreme heat, as well as on saving throws against spells that deal fire damage.


## Valuable Items



*   **Cold fire** is a form of continual flame that occurs naturally in Fernia; the flames have the texture of warm putty. 


*   **Fernian ashes **are created from the wood of rare trees found only in the Sea of Fire. If a spellcaster discards a pinch of Fernian ashes while casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals fire damage, their spell deals fire damage as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.
