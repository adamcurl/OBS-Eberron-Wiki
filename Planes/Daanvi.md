# Daanvi: The Perfect Order


## Moon: Nymm

The cities of Daanvi are laid out in a perfect grid with buildings whose height and width are in perfect unison so that one district does not stick out among the rest. The cities are in great condition with no sign of decay. However, individuality is crushed and innovation is at a stand-still.

Although crowded, the denizens (**modrons**, **angels**, **formians**, and **devils**) move in perfect unison at the same pace. The denizens of Daanvi perform administrative, organized work and perform the same cycle every day.  They also have the appearance of metallic, gear-filled constructs. It is impossible to convince a denizen to defy its nature. Each creature has the following property:

**Axiomatic Mind.** The creature can’t be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or instructions.


## Effects

*   
**Plane of Truth.** A creature can’t tell a deliberate lie. It can avoid answering questions, or be evasive in its answers, as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.


*   
**Impeded Illusion.** When a creature casts an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is halved.


*   
**The Eyes of the Law. **When a creature casts a divination spell, its range is doubled; if that spell has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is also doubled.


*   
**No Chance.** The first time in a round (or any time outside of combat) that a creature makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw (other than a death saving throw), treat the roll as a 10. If the creature has advantage or disadvantage on that roll, it only rolls one die, and treats the other one as a 10.


*   
**Flowing Time.** For every 10 minutes that pass in Daanvi, only 1 minute passes in the Material Plane. So if a creature spends 10 days arguing a case before a Daanvian court, less than a day has passed on Eberron.

## Denizens



*   **Modrons: **Do assigned tasks and obey laws with no concept of justice or oppression


*   **Inevitables:**
	-   **Maruts: **Enforce contracts and laws with no concept of justice or oppression
    -   **Kolyarut: **A legion of entities hosted throughout different construct bodies that reside beneath the Hall of Justice, with absolute authority over enforcing the law.



*   **Angels: **Enforce laws, but act fairly with justice. They have little time, but are kind and helpful

   	*   **Devas **act as local authorities that can serve as a lawyer, counselor, or sage. They reflect on the data modrons record.
    *   **Planetars **serve as high ministers and guardians of important gates and sites.
    *   **Solars **dwell in the Panopticon. Thirteen Solars monitor and administer justice over the other planes of Eberron (except the Material Plane).
        *   Hazariel, the Solar of [[Syrania]]
            *   Casts down Radiant Idols
        *   Azazar, the Solar of [[Xoriat]]
            *   Has never been called to Xoriat
        *   Tyrala, the Solar of [[Dal Quor]]
            *   Went to investigate Dal Quor being thrown off the planar axis. She hasn’t been seen since.



*   **Devils: **Represent the law as an oppressive force used for personal gain. They look to exploit loopholes and use the law as a weapon. They can mostly be found in the Iron Ward.  Orthons and erinyes apprehend lawbreakers, while pit fiends serve as executioners in the Hall of Justice.


    *   **Councilor Alashta (Amnizu) **wields absolute power over the Iron Ward
    *   **Imps **relay information to the higher ups
    *   **Chain devils and Erinyes **serve as the brutal police force



*   **Formians: **Ant-like humanoids that work out of various Hive layers


*   **Subjects: **Vague, humanoid-like figures with no personality or goals. They are usually the same race as the viewer.

## Layers

Daanvi is home to hundreds of layers, where time is consistent across all of them and each portal is clearly labeled and easily found with angelic guides happy to assist. Daanvi has its own calendar, but it can be easily translated to any other plane’s. Lesser portals are guarded by modrons, while major portals may be maintained by a horned devil or planetar. Travel passes can be obtained at the Prime Gate, though violating local ordinances can result in a revoked travel pass.



*   **The Prime Gate **

    *   Comprised of hundreds of orderly denizens moving between other portals. All travelers must enter Daanvi by The Prime Gate or be in violation of the law. Travelers must also obtain a travel pass from the Passage Authority, which changes day-to-day. 
        *   An angel will easily let anyone with a good reason to be there through. 
        *   A modron will have immense lines, a lot of redundant paperwork, a reason for travel, and might only allow travel to specific layers and other minor restrictions, like to outside food or water. 
        *   A devil will try and extort or torment the traveler by all means of bureaucratic paperwork, bribes, or favors.



*   **The Panopticon**

    *   The grand towers of the Panopticon are larger than the entire city of Sharn, with sections dedicated to scrying on each plane. With a high level of security,  adventurers must have an exceptional reason to secure a travel pass allowing admittance to the Panopticon, and the immortals who work there are not inclined to answer questions.
    *   Countless modrons observe crystal balls. There are chambers in which angels and devils stand around wide scrying pools, replaying recent events. And in the highest chamber of the Panopticon, twelve solars—with one seat empty—contemplate the events occurring in the planes they are bound to and wait to be summoned by the authorities of those planes.



*   **The Hall of Justice**
    *   Filled with an impossible number of courts where immortals discuss the latest actions of other entities across the planes. Judgement is made and stored in the Infinite Archive, but action is never taken. \
		The weightier matters are resolved before an inevitable tribunal, led by a Kolyarut. The tribunal is typically filled out with a planetar and an amnizu, each working to sway the Kolyarut’s deciding vote to their side.
    *   Adventurers who violate the laws of Daanvi are brought before an immortal tribunal. Usually this is a straightforward matter; the judges question the accused. The accused is granted an Advocate and opposed by a Voice of Justice; typically one of these is an angel, the other a devil. Both of these immortals may conjure images from the lives of the accused, drawing on the records gathered from the Panopticon. Once a case is resolved, the ruling is final.

*   **The Infinite Archive**

    *   This archive contains records on every being that’s ever existed. Here, the data gathered by the Panopticon and the rulings of the Hall of Justice are recorded and efficiently preserved. Records focus on each individual’s deeds, whether they’ve adhered to or violated countless codes of legal and moral standards. Daanvi doesn’t generally do anything with this data; they have no jurisdiction to act on it. Mortals must present an excellent reason—or bribe a devil— to get access to the Archive, but it’s not as restricted as the Panopticon. 



*   **The Iron Ward**


    *   The Iron Ward, a city of gray stone, embodies the worst aspects of oppressive law. Councilor Alashta, a cruel amnizu, wields absolute power and can’t be questioned or challenged. While the devils in this ward can’t punish adventurers “unjustly,” they can tempt visitors into misconduct. The police and councilors twist the law and weaponize it, but ultimately even they must obey the laws.



*   **The Inescapable Prison**


    *   Maintained by devils, this oppressive layer is the embodiment of prison—the inevitable consequence of challenging the law that makes Dreadhold look like a cell in the local sheriff’s office. It’s designed to hold celestials, elementals, and other beings with vast power; there are convicts here from a half-dozen planes of existence. Mortals can also be imprisoned here; their biological processes are put in suspension, so they don’t need to eat or drink, and they don’t age. 


## Coterminous and Remote

There are no obvious effects, although some tie the coterminous period with great growth in civilization and unity and the remote period with great strife and individuality. Each cycle lasts 100 years.


## Valuable items

*   
**Unbreakable contract.** In the Hall of Justice, any two creatures can negotiate a contract before a Kolyarut. The terms are inscribed on an enchanted sheet of gold (worth 5,000 gp) and bound to a marut, which acts to enforce the contract.
