# Dolurrh: The Realm of the Dead


## Moon: Aryth

   Endless caverns stretch throughout Dolurrh, bleak passages of gray stone. Wherever you go, shadowy figures reach toward you, imploring, but you feel only the faintest chill as their insubstantial fingers pass through you. Mist pools around your feet, and as you press forward, you realize this swirling mist is moaning. This is no natural phenomenon; these are the remnants of souls who have forgotten themselves. 


   Mortal spirits are drawn to Dolurrh within moments of death, and their memories begin to decay immediately. Within days, most spirits no longer have any desire to leave Dolurrh, and within weeks, most only have the faintest memories of their previous lives. Followers of the Sovereign Host say this is the soul ascending to a higher form of existence. Followers of the Silver Flame say the soul joins the flame and all that remains is a husk. This is why Dolurrh is also called the Gateway.


## Effects


*   **Eternal Ennui.** When a creature enters Dolurrh, it immediately gains one level of ennui (described in the “Ennui” sidebar). While in Dolurrh, this level of ennui can’t be removed by rest or by any other means. It’s immediately removed when the creature leaves Dolurrh. Creatures native to Dolurrh are immune to this property’s effects.


*   **Impeded Magic.** In order to cast a spell of 1st level or higher, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.


*   **Inevitable Entrapment.** Whenever a creature finishes a short or long rest, it must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it gains one level of ennui. Each time it makes this saving throw, the DC increases by 1. Whenever a creature ends a 24-hour period without finishing a long rest, it must make this saving throw as if it had just finished a rest, but its roll is made with disadvantage. Creatures native to Dolurrh are immune to this property’s effects.


*   **Timeless.** Time passes at the same rate as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers. Creatures can benefit from resting, suffer damage, and die. However, a creature on Dolurrh doesn’t age, and doesn’t need to eat, sleep, or drink.

## Denizens



*   **The Quick: **Native creatures of Dolurrh, bound to the cycle of transition and immune to ennui.


    *    **Nalfeshnee **demons patrol the Catacombs of Dolurrh, dispersing melds and lemures and dealing with mortal intruders. They appear as large humanoids whose features are shrouded in gray mist, and they delight in crushing mortals and pulling the shades from their corpses, as well as consuming lemures.
    *   **Marut **inevitables are powerful guardians, crafted in the Crucible of Dolurrh, forged from husksteel, and tasked to preserve the cycle of life and death. Maruts are occasionally dispatched to Eberron to intervene with acts of resurrection, or when a lich or mummy is created. This is why House Jorasco always casts augury before resurrecting someone.
    *   **Shadar-kai** are servants of the Queen of the Dead, shades granted new life. Though their new forms appear elf-like, they might’ve been any sort of humanoid in their previous life; when they caught the Queen’s attention, she preserved their soul from entrapment. The shadar-kai serve in the Vault of Memories, and occasionally as her hands on Eberron.
    *   **The Librarian** is in charge of the Vault of Memories.
        *   The Librarian is a massive hooded figure— his books are likewise enormous. 
        *   He interviews each shade and makes a record of its life.
        *   It’s said that he can be many places at once, allowing him to speak to every shade, capturing the story of its life, before it fades.
        *   His power is such that an entire life can be confined to a single large page. Every sigil inscribed holds a crucial memory, and if a creature is proficient in Arcana, they can read the symbol to experience that memory.
    *   **The Smith of Souls **is in charge of the Crucible.
        *   She wears a mask of black steel and an apron of dragonhide. When forging maruts, she takes the form of a giant, and when crafting tiny trinkets, a gnome. It’s possible that she collects the memories of mortal artisans, and can replicate their works at her forge.



*   **The Dead: **The spirits of dead mortals.


    *   **Shades **are mortal souls that are freshly arrived in Dolurrh. They maintain a portion of their memory and original appearance, though they’re insubstantial and can’t interact with material objects. Most are incapable of taking actions on their own, and they’re often found lost in thought, trying to remember something they’ve forgotten, or fixating on a past mistake.
    *   **Husks (Meld) **are harmless shades that have been overcome by ennui and possess only the vaguest memories of their mortal existence. Most retain a semblance of their mortal shape, but they continue to fade over decades, eventually merging with other husks to form masses of moaning mist. They are immune to ennui.
    *   **Ghosts **are formed when a shade clings to a particular memory with such intensity that even Dolurrh can’t completely eradicate it—perhaps a terrible mistake or a bitter grudge. The rest of the spirit’s memories fade, and it becomes immune to ennui, but this ember remains, defining its existence. Ghosts are driven by a primal desire to return to Eberron and can only find peace if their unfinished business is resolved.



*   **The Lingering: **Ethereal creatures formed from memories of pain, of cruelty, of anger, and are immune to ennui, but they’re a waste product, not the plane’s desired result. The Quick destroy them whenever they are found.


    *   **Lemures** are formed from hateful memories or deeds.
    *   **Sorrowsworn **are the emotional residue of hundreds or thousands of people.



*   **The Queen of the Dead: **The most powerful being in Dolurrh and dwells in the great spire that rises up above the Vault of Memories; most of the time, she remains silent in Dolurrh, unknown and unknowable.


    *   Though she existed long before the elves, the Queen appears as an elf woman, her face hidden by a cracked alabaster mask, her robes of black feathers trimmed with silver. 
    *   She can pluck shades from the cycle of entrapment, and even grant them new life, creating shadar-kai by housing them in new bodies. Other souls, she saves but doesn’t restore, preserving them in the Vault of Memories. 
    *   Some souls are combined by her, where a raven might contain the spirit of a dead poet.
    *   She collects secrets and memories, plucking her favorites from those gathered by the Librarian and keeping them in her personal collection.
    *    Sometimes she directly opposes mortal necromancers, especially Lady Illmarrow. At other times, she seems interested in killing specific people, perhaps so she can preserve their spirits or their memories. But such direct action is extremely rare, remarkable if it occurs more than once in a century.


## Layers


   Dollurh is gray and gloomy and the only four layers ever discovered serve a specific purpose instead of representing an idea.



*   **The Catacombs**


    *   Endless tunnels of gray stone where all humanoid spirits wind up. The tunnels range from tight corridors to grandiose halls. Nalfeshnees herd shades crying out for help into pens and scrape lemures off of the walls. The catacombs may be larger than Eberron itself, but if you know the correct runes to follow, you can traverse this layer quickly.



*   **The Kennel**


    *   The Kennel is similar in appearance to the Catacombs, but contains the shades and husks of beasts and monstrosities, along with the nalfeshnee and maruts that tend them. Beast spirits rarely linger long in Dolurrh, as most have fewer memories to erase.



*   **The Crucible**


    *   In this grand foundry, tended by shadar-kai and guarded by newly forged maruts, the immortal spirit known as the Smith of Souls refines the essence of faded spirits into husksteel for form the armor and weapons of the shadar-kai. She also creates  maruts from the husks of brave souls, along with other artifacts.



*   **The Vault of Memories**


    *   As the heart of Dolurrh, this tower, carved up through gray stone, is larger than any of the great towers of Sharn. The lowest levels hold the Vault’s library, where the Librarian dwells. The many floors of the library hold countless books of preserved lives, carefully tended by shadar-kai scribes.
    *   In the halls above the library, the Queen of the Dead keeps her many treasures. What seem to be obsidian statues are actually shades, crystallized to prevent them from being entrapped and lost in Dolurrh. Paintings and crystals contain memories that the Queen has chosen to isolate. Beyond these are countless trinkets and oddities, items collected by her shadar-kai over the vast scope of history.
    *   Higher still are the chambers of the Queen herself, where she usually sits in silent contemplation, listening to the whispers of the countless shades in her domain.


## Coterminous and Remote


   Dolurrh has a slow planar cycle. Traditionally, once a century, it becomes coterminous for a full year. Fifty years after that, it’s remote for a full year. 


   **Coterminous: **it’s easier for ghosts to slip from the Realm of the Dead into the Material Plane, especially around Dolurrhi manifest zones. Any spell or ability that raises the dead can also serve as a conduit for unwanted spirits; roll on the Dolurrhi Resurrection Mishaps table when any such spell is cast.


   **Remote: **traditional resurrection magic, such as revivify or reincarnate, can’t pull spirits back from Dolurrh. The only way to raise the dead in these times is by traveling to Dolurrh itself and pulling the shade back to the world. There is also an influx in ghosts since the dead’s spirits can easily resist Dolurrh’s pull.


## Valuable Items



*   **Husksteel **can appear not only as dark metal, but also as slick black leather, dark iridescent cloth, or other substances. Such an object could be crafted from a single spirit—a dagger whose edge is forged from a single moment of pain—or from the emotional residue of multiple husks.
