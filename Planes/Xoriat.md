# Xoriat: The Realm of Madness

   To mortals, Xoriat is known as the Realm of Madness due to their inability to comprehend this plane. However, illithids call Xoriat the Realm of Revelations . . . and this may be more accurate. Xoriat embodies the unnatural and can interfere with your ability to process reality. It’s a window into the workings of reality that mortals normally don’t see, ones they’re ill equipped to handle. It suggests that time and space, order and chaos, war and peace—all of these are inventions. They’re the foundations mortal lives are built on . . . but what lies under those foundations? What was there before the house was built, and what will come after? Xoriat holds the answers to those questions, and infinitely more as well.


   Though the fact is often overlooked, all mortals have a connection to Xoriat. The influence of Xoriat drives the desire to question reality. It can be a source of inspiration, especially for artists; it helps people challenge their assumptions and see things in an entirely new way. But Xoriat’s also the sun that melts the wings of any who draw too close. From a distance, its influence can be a positive force, but mortals who gaze too deeply into Xoriat can lose touch with their native reality, losing the ability to navigate the natural world. So Xoriat is a deeply dangerous place, but the plane itself isn’t evil or destructive. It’s part of the universal balance, as important as any of the other concepts of the planes. Xoriat is a glimpse at what lies behind and beyond, of the other ways reality could have been—and of the unseen ways it is.

## Xoriat and the Maze of Reality

^67afcd


   Time sometimes moves at different rates in different planes, but it always moves forward . . . except in Xoriat. Imagine time as a maze and the Material Plane as a rat moving through it, with the other planes worn as a crown. This is how the Draconic Prophecy works. It doesn’t tell you what will happen, because that hasn’t been decided yet. It’s a roadmap to the maze, revealing that if you take a left turn at “Queen Aurala is assassinated” and then turn right at “Breland becomes a democracy,” you’ll reach “Sul Khatesh is released from her prison.” The Prophecy shows the path you need to take to achieve the outcome you desire—a map to the many possibilities of the future.


   But Xoriat isn’t bound to the rat. It hovers above the maze. And adventurers could return to the wrong time when they leave it, falling farther back in the maze. They could find themselves in the Empire of Dhakaan, or in the midst of the War of the Mark. And in the process, they could change the future. In doing this, the adventurers have dropped a new rat in the maze. This new rat becomes the Prime Material Plane. It snatches the old rat’s crown of planes, becoming the reality where all the planes converge and where time moves forward. But the other rat is still out there—forgotten and lost, huddled in a corner, but still alive. And it’s possible that if the adventurers return to Xoriat, they could change their mind; they could find their way back to that original rat, returning it to its role as the Prime Material Plane. So Xoriat gives the possibility for dramatic change— but it’s always possible to restore a forgotten past.


   This view is critical to understanding the daelkyr. They stand above the maze, but they can also descend into it. They experiment on the rat, changing it. What happens if they make too many changes? It’s possible the rat might crawl into a corner to die and a new rat be released: perhaps the old Prime is lost and a new world moves forward. This is what the gith believe happened with their world. The gith lived on a world that was once the Prime Material Plane. Now it may just be another rat lost and forgotten in the maze. Should the daelkyr rise and complete their work, it’s possible the current Eberron could be torn away from the planes; it would still exist, but as a forgotten shadow of the new central reality that takes its place.


   Most scholars in Khorvaire would call this theory madness, and so Xoriat receives its name. But others might say that this is in keeping with the myth of the Progenitors. [[Irian]] is the beginning, [[Mabar]] is the end—and Xoriat could be the point that stands above the journey, the high perch from which the Progenitors could study their work. Xoriat isn’t bound by the laws that bind the rest of the planes, and it holds all the ideas that were discarded. Perhaps the Sovereigns didn’t entirely build reality, but rather, they sculpted it—chipping things away and dropping them into Xoriat.


## Effects


*   **Unpredictable Magic.** Immediately after a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook.


*   **Dangerous Revelations.** Whenever a creature finishes a short or long rest, or is reduced to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it’s afflicted with a random form of short-term madness (see chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). If it later fails this saving throw an additional time, its previous madness effect is replaced with a new one.


*   **Time Is an Illusion.** More than any other plane, time is unreliable in Xoriat. Adventurers could be trapped in the Realm of Madness for what feels like a lifetime, then find only a moment has passed on Eberron. It’s even possible for them to return to Eberron before they left, potentially becoming stranded in another time.


*   **Strange Reality.** The things adventurers rely on—gravity, time, their identity itself—aren’t always reliable in Xoriat. When characters enter a new layer, the DM can choose a property from the Properties of Xoriat table. This property could apply the entire time the adventurers are on that layer, or it could change when combat begins, whenever a creature rolls a 1 on a d20, or at any other time the DM chooses. There are no saving throws against these effects, and an effect impacts all creatures in the layer until the DM replaces that property with a new one. In describing a property, don’t just describe the effect, but explain how it manifests. Haste and slow reflect a shift in the local flow of time. When creatures can detect thoughts, they can hear the thoughts of others flowing like music all around them, and if they concentrate on a single creature, they can translate the meaning of the melody. Each effect reflects a strange new property of reality in this layer.

## Denizens


*   **The Daelkyr**

    *   There are no known accounts of mortals traveling to Xoriat—at least, none who returned—so adventurers who do so are likely undertaking a historic journey. And in that journey, they may make a shocking discovery—though the daelkyr may be bound in [[Khyber]], they are also still in Xoriat. Dyrrn the Corruptor, Valaara, Belashyrra—each dwells in a domain in Xoriat, attended by their servants and their armies. This ties to Xoriat’s uncanny relationship with time. The daelkyr may be in Xoriat because they haven’t left yet, or they might’ve already been released from their prisons and returned to Xoriat. Again, if time is a maze, the daelkyr stand above it looking down—but at the same time, they are also running in the maze. They can’t return to Eberron now, because they’re already there; but this may be why they seem unconcerned with their long imprisonment, because they’re also watching it all unfold from above. So adventurers could interact with any of the daelkyr in Xoriat, but fighting them there won’t impact their actions on Eberron. However, it could help adventurers learn about the weaknesses of the daelkyr, or perhaps obtain tools or weapons to use against them in the future.

*   **Aberrations**

    *   The natural inhabitants of the plane are often so alien that mortals don’t even recognize them as living things. Most of the aberrations that people are familiar with on Eberron aren’t creations of Xoriat itself. Rather, the daelkyr, powers designed to interact with the Material Plane and its with mortals, created these aberrations as their servants, soldiers, and mementos of past conquests. In Eberron, most daelkyr have mixed forces; mind flayers could be found serving any of the great lords. In Xoriat, they’re more segregated; beholders dwell in the domain of Belashyrra, and mind flayers in the realm of Dyrrn.
    *   While aberrations created by the daelkyr are usually dangerous, there are also aberrations generated by the layers themselves. These planar creatures are alien and disturbing, but aren’t threatening unless provoked.
    *   **The Varr** are kind, generous, telepathic halflings. But they’re not quite like their Eberron cousins—they have compound eyes, barbed tongues, and they spit acid on food to digest it.
    *   **The Craiss** are tiny insectoid creatures that inherently know the language of creatures they speak to. They’ve always had a really bad day and they won’t stop complaining about it.
    *   **The \[[scent of onions]]** is a sentient ooze that can assume a humanoid shape. It can produce sounds, but communicates with its own kind using smell, touch, and taste.
    *   **The Cya** are invisible, incorporeal beings who are only able to communicate by animating the reflections of other creatures.
    *   **The \[[pleasure of seeing a familiar friend]]** are a race of empathic plants. They communicate not through speech, but through projecting emotions.
    *   **The Xaelin** appear identical to humans, except for their smooth, featureless faces without eyes, ears, or nose. They possess truesight with a range of 60 feet, but can’t see, hear, or otherwise perceive anything beyond that range. The Xaelin claim to know nothing about Eberron—but despite this, their customs and fashions emulate cultures from throughout Eberron’s history.



*   **Powers of the Void**

    *   The daelkyr aren’t the most powerful forces in Xoriat. There are greater powers in the void, spirits so vast and alien that they can only be perceived by the ripples they create in reality. Both the Unseen Citadel and Belashyrra are ideas in the mind of something greater. Do these powers slumber? Do they consciously adjust the rules of their layers? Or are they simply ideas cast aside by the Progenitors, models of reality that were ultimately abandoned? If Xoriat is the realm of discarded concepts, this could be the drive behind the daelkyr’s endless quest to disfigure—or perfect—reality.


## Layers


   Xoriat is a void lacking not only matter, but also space and time, and a mortal creature that enters it effectively ceases to exist. But there are powers in this void, and the layers of Xoriat reflect their thoughts. Each of the daelkyr dwells in a layer, the place that spawned that daelkyr; this layer usually reflects the daelkyr in tone, and it can use its lair actions anywhere in its layer. However, not all of Xoriat’s layers can support mortal life; there’s a layer where intense gravity crushes any physical creature, and a layer where all matter is transformed into pure thought.


   Adventurers need to find portals to move from layer to layer. Portals are unique based on the layer’s properties of each layer, and using a portal always has a price. Sometimes the price is paid in memories; the DM sets the emotional tone of the memory (joy, sorrow, anger), then each player describes the memory their character has lost. With other portals, the price may be knowledge, but this isn’t taken from the adventurers— rather, when they pass through the portal, they learn a secret they might have rather not known.



*   **The Unseen Citadel**

    *   This is the stronghold and birthplace of the daelkyr Belashyrra. The Lord of Eyes imagined the beholders and brought that vision to life, and the Citadel is home to a host of beholderkin. Tiny floating eyes buzz about like insects. Millipede-like creatures have rows of eyes running down their backs. The true beholders are mostly focused in deep contemplation of specific things, and don’t pay attention to outsiders unless they’re disturbed. Some study strange paintings. Others watch scrying pools reflecting images of Eberron or other planes. And some examine seemingly mundane objects, such as a rusty iron key, a dead rabbit, or an expensive hat. However, there are a few that patrol the Citadel, watchful for intruders.
    *   The surfaces of the Citadel are made from an iridescent material that your eyes can’t quite focus on, as if the walls and floor are blurred. There are mirrors spread around the halls. Some run slow and show you younger than they are; others show glimpses of the future. Scrying pools reveal secrets you don’t want to know—current events on Eberron, scenes from the past, or the possible future.



*   **The Fields of Thought**

    *   This layer is the domain of Dyrrn the Corruptor. Purple fields are bathed in ultraviolet light, and fluorescent sculptures shed eerie dim light. Varr farmers dance as they tend the fields, but what they cultivate are emotions; anyone walking through a field feels a powerful emotion (fear, sorrow, anger, guilt) washing over them. Each field has an outpost containing an elder brain, with a bright line of thought transmitting the emotions to Dyrrn’s tower at the heart of the layer.
    *   Dyrrn’s tower is made of glowing threads of pure thought intertwined around a massive steel spinal column. This tower is filled with the tools of fleshcrafting. There are pools of blood and canals of amniotic fluid, massive pulsing organs waiting for a purpose, and untended tendrils crawling across the floor. Adventurers might find a chamber that contains halfformed clones of the adventurers themselves . . . or perhaps the clones are completed, and consider the adventurers to be evil doppelgangers
    *   The spire amplifies Dyrrn’s telepathic abilities, letting it sense all living creatures within the layer. Dyrrn specializes in corruption, and it may challenge adventurers with mental projections, such as people plucked from their memories, who seek to turn them against their allies.



*   **A House Built from Hate.** Each character sees the house’s form slightly differently, but they all feel the hate in the walls. Mirrors reflect images of things the viewer hates, and books in the house chronicle the hateful deeds committed by everyone the adventurers know—including each other. The longer the adventurers stay in the houses, the easier it becomes to hate each other . . . or themselves.


*   **Empty White Space. **There’s seemingly no end to this endless void of bleak solitude. To proceed, the characters must act out their travel—pretending to travel just as they pretend there is meaning in their lives. If they can keep up the charade, the world they imagine will take shape around them.


*   **A Lush Orchard. **The trees grow secrets, while more buzz around in the air like tiny birds. Some of them may be secrets of the adventurers, or those of their enemies. Others are secrets of strangers and secrets about reality. Do the adventurers block their ears, or do they try to listen?

## Coterminous and Remote


   **Coterminous: **The last time Xoriat was coterminous, the daelkyr brought their armies through the walls of reality and laid waste to the Empire of Dhakaan. The seals crafted long ago by the Gatekeeper druids keep the daelkyr bound in Khyber, but they also keep Xoriat from becoming coterminous.


   **Remoted: **Xoriat’s remote phases have no known effect, and like Kythri, they’re unpredictable, though the phases tend to come and go far more slowly than Kythri’s do.


## Valuable Items


*   **Symbiont items **


*   **Daelkyr artifacts **mostly dealing with time and reality


*   **Maddening knowledge**


*   **Physical transformations**
