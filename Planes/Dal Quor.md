# Dal Quor: The Region of Dreams

## Moon: Crya (believed to be destroyed)

Tens of thousands of years ago, the giants of Xen’drik shattered the ties between Dal Quor and the Material Plane. Since then, it’s been permanently remote, and no naturally occurring manifest zone to Dal Quor has been discovered. Not even plane shift or astral travel can allow direct contact with the Region of Dreams. And yet, all you have to do to visit, is close your eyes and dream.

Dal Quor is the realm of dreams, a place of imagination where memory and emotion can shape reality. Our dreams are defined by our experiences and desires, and we rarely remember them when they’re over. However, if a quori takes interest, it will prey on mortal dreams, twisting them to produce the emotions they crave, turning it into a nightmare.

The quori believe the heart of Dal Quor is itself the dream of an immense, ancient spirit, and that they themselves are simply part of its dream. They call this the Quor Tarai—the Dream of the Age.  Forty thousand years ago, the giants of Xen’drik fought a war with Dal Quor—but none of the current quori remember this war or anything that happened before it. They believe this is because the Quor Tarai came to an end. Dal Quor woke from its dream, then immediately returned to its slumber and began to dream again . . . but it was a new dream, with entirely new quori.

The present Quor Tarai is il-Lashtavar, the Great Darkness that Dreams. It’s malevolent and cruel, and that’s reflected by the quori it’s created. But a handful of quori didn’t fit in this dream. These are the quori that became the kalashtar, who consider themselves harbingers of transformation. The kalashtar believe that the next incarnation of the Quor Tarai will be an age of hope and compassion; they call it il-Yannah, the Great Light.

*   **Extremely Morphic.** The environment of Dal Quor can shift at any moment. These changes are generally drawn from the mind of the current dreamer, but at the DM’s discretion, the thoughts of adventurers might impact another creature’s dream that they’re currently experiencing.


*   **Extended Illusion. **When a creature casts an illusion spell with a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is doubled. Spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.


*   **Flowing Time.** For every 10 minutes that pass in Dal Quor, only 1 minute passes on the Material Plane. While sleeping for 8 hours, a creature could spend 3 days in Dal Quor.

## Denizens



*   **Dreamers: **Any creature that dreams can be found in this plane at any time, creating their own island. Some dreamers are lucid and in full control of their actions, due to either training or magic. Lucid dreamers can move between islands. Dreamers that die in this plane suffer no consequences if it is a part of the dream. However, if a quori is involved in the death of a dreamer, that dreamer might not gain the benefit of a long rest and suffer 3d6 psychic damage.


*   **Figments and Drifters: **


    *   **Figments** are just a manifestation of someone or an idea that the dreamer knows. Once the dreamer wakes up, the figments cease to exist. The figment only has the knowledge of what the dreamer knows of the figment. However, if you’re in someone else’s dream—or if a quori has taken control of your dream—then the figments can surprise you, because their capabilities and knowledge are drawn from someone else’s mind. Figments can have whatever stat block they want. 
    *   **Drifters **are powerful figments that developed the ability to persist beyond the dream that created them—becoming truly sentient spirits instead of simple manifestations. They can travel between dream island.



*   **Quori: **
		Figments of il-Lashtavar. However, these figments are immortal, and don’t disappear when a mortal’s dream ends; if they’re destroyed, they’re simply reborn within the heart of il-Lashtavar. Like other figments, they come into existence knowing the role they are supposed to play: they are shapers of nightmares. Each type of quori feeds on a particular emotion.  \
		When a quori enters a dream, it can create new figments, alter the story’s script, or change its own appearance (though its statistics remain the same). If the invading quori is killed within the dream, the story reverts to the original script, so most quori prefer to remain in the background while shaping a dream. However, the quori don’t shape _every_ nightmare, as there are only thousands of them. The quori believe they’re fighting for their survival, and they use their abilities to manipulate mortals and the waking world.


*   **Interlopers: **Some creatures in Dal Quor are neither figments nor mortal dreamers.


    *   **The Fey of the Fading Dream: **Taer Lian Doresh is a feyspire, one of the eladrin cities of [[Thelanis]]. Long ago, the tyrant empyrean Cul’sir cursed the feyspire and cast it into Dal Quor. Caught in the transformation of the Quor Tarai, these eladrin became embodiments of classic nightmares and seek to spread fear among mortals. \
		Taer Lian Doresh now exists between Dal Quor and the Material Plane. The eladrin of this feyspire can freely pass to both planes, but other creatures can only enter Taer Lian Doresh and return to their plane of origin; they can’t use it as a portal to the other plane. 
    *   **The Draconic Eidolon:**  Many dragons aren’t 100% confident in becoming immortal divine beings by passing through Dolurrh. Using an eldritch machine hidden deep in Argonnessen, the most powerful dragons can perform a ritual that tethers their spirits to a psychic anchor in Dal Quor in order to achieve immortality. \
		This Draconic Eidolon, a monument in the Ocean of Dreams, holds the souls of dragons long dead instead of releasing them to Dolurrh. The dragons no longer exist physically; like the Undying Court, they’re a union of spirits, possessing greater power together than they would individually. They can’t leave the Eidolon, but possess many powerful secrets and hidden knowledge.


## Layers


   Dal Quor doesn’t have traditional layers. The entire plane is an ocean, and when creatures dream, they create an island. When they wake up, this island ceases to exist. However, there are some permanent islands.



*   **The Ocean of Dreams**


    *   A vast expanse of psychic space surrounds il-Lashtavar, home to millions of mortal dreams ranging from all types of creatures.  From the outside, these islands appear as glittering bubbles, each with an image of its dreamer within it that are loosely arranged based on the physical location of the dreamer.



*   **The Riedran Sea**


    *   Over centuries, the Inspired have built a network of monoliths in Riedra, psychic anchors called hanbalani altas. These allow them to control everyone’s dreams over a vast radius. Dreams are typically tailored to the region, including local news and instructions. However, if they choose, the Inspired can broadcast a single dream to all of Sarlona.
    *   Within Dal Quor, this manifests as a distinctive region of the Ocean of Dreams—an array of hundreds of thousands of islands, dream-bubbles arranged in perfect symmetrical rows, with identical images in each bubble.



*   **The Uul Dhakaan**


    *   Jhazaal Dhakaan united the dar through an act of epic bardic magic. When the dar dream, they don’t create their own islands in the Ocean. Instead, they are drawn to a vast, ongoing dream—the Uul Dhakaan, a vision of what the Dhakaani Empire could and should be. This enormous dream is filled with countless figments—both background soldiers, artisans, and facsimiles of legendary champions whose memories have been preserved. Most dar aren’t lucid dreamers and they don’t fully remember the time they spend in the Uul Dhakaan, but it reinforces Dhakaani values and traditions.
    *   Chot’uul guardians maintain outposts throughout the dream, along with a great monastery in the capital city. The magic woven into the dream ensures that the throne in the imperial palace remains empty—for now. But when a new emperor is chosen and has the support of the majority of the dar, they’ll hold the throne in the Uul Dhakaan as well as in the Material Plane.



*   **Il-Lashtavar**


    *   The dark heart of Dal Quor, il-Lashtavar, is the current incarnation of the Quor Tarai and the source and home of all quori. It’s a menagerie of nightmares, a showcase of terrors that haunt the dreams of mortals. On the edges of il-Lashtavar, corpses dangle from the trees of a haunted orchard. Blood drips from the leaves of a terrifying topiary maze. While the basic form of these nightmares is stable, they feed on the psyches of nearby mortals. Adventurers walking through the orchard see the hanging corpses as the people they most care about, or even as themselves—whatever is most disturbing to each intruder.
    *   Those who press through this outer ring of nightmares find the great fortress-city of the Devourer of Dreams, the kalaraq quori who coordinates the actions of the Dreaming Dark on Eberron. Quori in the Dreaming Dark can return whenever they want.
    *   At the very center of this shadowy, blood-soaked fortress is a pool of shadows. It’s here that newborn quori emerge when they’re reincarnated, and here that the Devourer of Dreams descends into the pool to commune with the Great Darkness. The Great Darkness doesn’t act directly, but its presence can be felt in how the environment shifts to showcase the nightmares of intruders. Dreamers who die in this place can be trapped the same way kalaraq bind the souls of their victims. 
    *   In those regions of il-Lashtavar that appear to be outdoors, adventurers may notice a dark, nearly invisible moon in the sky. A sage with considerable skill in History or Arcana may recognize this as the moon Crya, thought to be destroyed in the Age of Giants. Perhaps it was thrown into Dal Quor and could somehow be returned, restoring the plane to its proper orbit— or perhaps this is only il-Lashtavar dreaming of the lost moon.


## Valuable Items

*   **Sentira **is a form of solidified emotion. It has an opalescent, organic texture similar to polished horn; the color depends on the emotion used in its creation, and the wearer can feel that emotion as a constant background presence in their mind. As a material, sentira is light and extremely strong, similar to mithral.
