# Irian: The Eternal Dawn

## Moon: Barrakas

   In Irian, birds sing in a fertile valley, while a group of settlers work together to raise their first home. Moving further in, you find the gleaming capital of a new empire, where cheering throngs celebrate in the streets. There are dozens of layers in Irian, and each one is a vision of life triumphant. Irian is the dawn that inevitably banishes even the darkest night, the promise of spring triumphing over the coldest winter. It’s the bastion of hope, the promise that life always find a way.

   Whenever [[Mabar]] tears a fragment from another plane, a new planar seed appears in Irian. Initially, this is a small layer, populated by embers and lumi, that has Irian’s planar properties. Over time, the layer grows and evolves, and the environment and its inhabitants take on the appearance of the void it’s to fill. Little by little, it loses the properties of Irian and adopts the properties of its destination plane; when it finally loses the Light of Life property, its ties to Irian are severed and it fully becomes part of the other plane, replacing the region lost to Mabar. While this new fragment usually doesn’t replace mortals and structures built, the lumi do tend to the embers and replace any lost immortals. Any newly created layer in Irian cannot leave its layer until its completion to ensure that harmful entities do not wreak havoc on Irian.


## Effects



*   **Radiant Power.** When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points or deals radiant damage, it’s treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.


*   **Necrotic Void. **In order to cast a spell that deals necrotic damage, a creature must succeed on a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.


*   **Pure Light.** There is no darkness in Irian. Any spell, effect, or other situation that would usually create darkness only reduces the lighting to dim light.


*   **Life Triumphant. **Undead creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. This has no effect on undead creatures that are sustained by Irian, such as the deathless elves of Aerenal.


*   **The Light of Life.** The light of Irian restores vitality, granting the following benefits to all living creatures. These have no effect on undead or constructs; however, undead creatures that are sustained by Irian, such as the deathless elves of Aerenal, benefit from these effects as if they were living creatures. ^160f3e


    *   On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a living creature with at least 1 hit point regains 3 (1d6) hit points.
    *   A living creature with 0 hit points becomes stable at the end of its turn.
    *   A living creature has resistance to poison damage
    *   A living creature has advantage on saving throws against poison, disease, and fear.



*   **Standard Time.** Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane, and is consistent across its layers.

## Denizens



*   **Embers**


    *   Embers are manifestations, not living creatures, that are linked to a spark—a tiny echo of a soul, each one tied to a living creature. An ember resembles the mortal whose spark fuels it, but it isn’t fully conscious and doesn’t have any complete memories, merely echoes of that mortal’s brightest joys, deepest hopes, and greatest deeds. You might even find your ember in Irian!
    *   These embers cannot be fully killed. There are far more sparks in Irian than embers (to ensure a peaceful and balanced existence). If one ember “dies”, Irian dips into the pool of sparks and creates a new one.



*   **Lumi**


    *   When a mortal dies and their soul goes to Dolurrh, the thread connecting them to Irian is severed. Any ember fueled by their spark dissolves and the spark—the essence of the hopes and brightest moments of the mortal’s life—begins to fade. But the sparks of the dead can merge together before they’re lost completely, creating a new, unique entity—a lumi, formed from the same positive energy as the embers, but possessing true consciousness and life. Unlike the embers, who aren’t fully conscious or aware of the memories they hold, lumi are sentient creatures, each with a unique identity, though their sparks give them fragments of many mortal lives.
    *   Lumi appear to be formed from solidified light, and generally take a body shape similar to the strongest of the sparks that formed them—usually those of sentient creatures. Their most distinctive feature is their head—a sphere of light suspended a few inches above their torso. Normally this is pure light, but with conscious effort, a lumi can sculpt and maintain a face. Their statistics can be represented by a priest or war priest, but they don’t need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep, they don’t age, and they’re immune to poison and disease. 
    
		When a lumi reaches 0 hit points, its body dissolves and its sparks fade. If an angel of Irian is nearby, it can consume these sparks; this won’t save the lumi, but at least those memories are preserved. While most lumi are humanoids, there may be lumi formed from the sparks of other creatures, like giants or dragons, that dwell in layers of their own kind.
    *   Lumi serve as the caretakers of the embers, and believe that by helping the embers play their roles, they’re strengthening the light in the mortals the embers are connected to. Lumi help develop and maintain the planar seeds, and some even surrender their identity in order to become new creatures within that seed; they believe that in doing this, they’re sowing the new layer with light. On rare occasions, lumi travel to other planes in service of the Architects. They are brave and compassionate, seeking always to spread hope, and ever prepared to lay down their lives for the greater good. Lumi can defend themselves, but they prefer to inspire others when possible, rather than resort to violence.



*   **Celestials**


    *   The angels of Irian embody the general principles of hope and compassion. Irian is the home of ki-rin and angels. The angels of Irian have wings formed of light, which they can conceal if they wish. In their true form, they’re luminescent humanoids of indeterminate species, but can choose to appear to mortals as a generic member of the viewer’s species. 
    *   **Ki-rin **act as emissaries for the Architects. Each planar seed has a ki-rin assigned to monitor it, help the lumi, and ease transition.
    *   **Devas **assist the lumi and help sustain the different layers; they are the knights and scholars of the Amaranthine City. Devas often change their form to play multiple roles within a layer.
    *   **Planetars **act as champions and ministers.
    *   **Solars** serve as the right hand of each Architect.



*   **The Architects**


    *   The most powerful spirits of Irian. Each embodies an aspect of the plane, and oversees a region within it. They’re unique celestials with great wisdom and power, but most of their time and energy is devoted to the planar seeds—guiding the growth of the seed, smoothing over problems, and adding a few personal touches. Planar seeds emerge within an Architect’s realm, expanding until they break off and join their new planes.
    *   The power of the Architects is largely bound to their realms. They can’t directly intervene in the Material Plane, though they can work with warlocks (as Celestial patrons) or send lumi. Often this involves the reintegration of a planar seed, or examining regions where [[Mabar]] has removed a fragment.
    *   **Dawn Empress** is the first and greatest of the Architects. She is in charge of the Amaranthine City. Her defining principle is growth, the opportunity to reach your full potential, and all layers of her realm reflect this. Her empire isn’t driven by conquest, but rather by exploration.  is a celestial figure wreathed in light, though she can assume the shape of any humanoid or angel. She presides over festivals and tends the needs of her people, but she spends much of her time focused on the cultivation of her planar seeds. She occasionally works with mortals, typically warlocks; while she may have missions tied to planar seeds or to clashing with agents of Mabar, she also gives her agents tasks that are designed to help them with their own growth and evolution.
    *   **The Gardner **is a blend of angel and plant—more humanoid than treant, but with skin of bark, a beard of leaves, and a crown of flowers. His principle is life and he is in charge of The Garden. Like all of the Architects, he’s devoted to his planar seeds, but he also spends time wandering the garden, both tending it and appreciating its wonders. He appreciates those who nurture and heal others, and this is the behavior he expects of any mortals he associates with.
    *   **Araam **is the Architect of the Refuge and embodies the concept of hope. She’s a wise advisor, and while she may not always have answers, she helps people look at their problems in new ways and see that all problems can be solved. She is the finest healer in Irian, and there are few injuries she cannot heal or curses she cannot break. There’s no monetary cost for the services of the Refuge, but Araam charges those who benefit to give hope to someone who needs it; they won’t be allowed to return to the Refuge until that debt is paid. 


## Layers


   It’s always morning in Irian; the skies are clear, the sun is fixed in the sky, and the moon Barrakas is faintly visible. The plane contains many layers, and it’s always growing new ones. In every layer, the story is always about life, growth, and hope. 


   The layers are linked in realms, each of which is bound to one of the Architects. The denizens and themes of a layer reflect the influence of that Architect, so all of the layers of the Garden have a focus on rustic nature, while those tied to the Amaranthine City reflect its rising imperial power. Within realms, layers are often connected by physical portals like a massive gate or a pool of light. Moving between realms requires plane shift or a ritual tied to that realm. These rituals may not be magical; they are simply secrets that have to be learned. If you’re in the Amaranthine City and you want to travel to the Garden, all you have to do is plant a flower and reflect on its beauty; those thoughts will carry you there.



*   **The Amaranthine City: Growth** ^f18382


    *   Considered to be the heart of Irian, this immense metropolis fills an entire layer and is led by the Dawn Empress. The Amaranthine City is the capital of an empire in its first bloom of glory. Gilded banners catch the wind. Armored angels and pegasi patrols pass overhead. People laugh in the streets, healthy and happy. Artisans create a mosaic depicting glorious victories. While this is an empire, the message isn’t about oppression, but one of potential. This is an empire where all the citizens are prosperous and all have equal opportunities. People are proud, the city is full of wonders, and the future is bright.



*   **The Garden: Life**


    *   The Garden is a vast zoological garden filled with foliage led by the Gardener. It contains every plant that can be found in the Material Plane, along with many that can’t. There are winding paths, peaceful pools, wondrous topiaries, and complicated hedge mazes. In contrast to the wilds of Lamannia, this is very carefully cultivated. The Garden is suffused with a sense of peace, beauty, and the wondrous things life can create. 
    *   The many layers of the Garden realm showcase various elements of fertility and the triumph of life. There are a few layers that are slightly darker than the rest of Irian, though still suffused with dim light in their darkest corners—these reflect the principle that life overcomes hardship. The message of the ruined castle isn’t to dwell on the destruction, but to see the flowers blooming on the walls. Most of the embers in the region take animal form, and ki-rin are the most common celestials.



*   **The Refuge: Hope**


    *   The Refuge is a vast fortress-monastery, though it has aspects of a spa as well and is led by Araam. It’s filled with tranquil groves, soothing baths, and places to rest and reflect. The fortress walls don’t represent potential conflict, but rather speak to the absolute security of the place—within its walls, you are safe from all threats. The Refuge holds healers who can treat your injuries, mediators who can talk through problems, and sages who may not know the answers you need, but can point you in the right direction. 
    *   While not all layers of Araam’s realm provide the security and succor of the Refuge itself, they all can provide comfort and hope. They don’t have the absolute peace of Syrania, but they make people feel there’s hope.


## Coterminous and Remote


   Traditionally, Irian is coterminous for ten days in the month of Eyre and remote for ten days in the month of Sypheros. These effects occur once every three years; the remote cycle comes a year and a half after it is coterminous.


   **Coterminous: **Health and fertility are enhanced, positive energy flows freely, and living creatures are infused with an abundant sense of hope. While Irian is coterminous, the Radiant Power property applies across Eberron and all creatures have advantage on saving throws against disease, poison, and fear.


   **Remote: **Colors seem to fade and a sense of psychic numbness pervades the world. All creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against fear and resistance to radiant damage. In addition, any effect that restores hit points—including spells and spending Hit Dice—only restores half the usual amount. However, creatures still regain full hit points after completing a long rest.


## Valuable Items



*   **Scrolls: **Some scrolls can provide Irian healing or teleportation to the Refuge


*   **Livewood: **Exotic lumber from Aerenal. This wood remains alive long after it has been cut from the tree and carved into its new form. Provided that it gets the typical amount of water and sunlight that would be available outside, the carved piece can remain alive indefinitely. This is of particular value to dryads and other fey that are bound to a specific living plant as livewood pieces are living but mobile.


*   **Araam’s crown: **A flower with remarkable healing properties. House Jorasco requires a steady supply for healing potions.


*   **Dawn’s glory: **a flower with euphoric properties and is used to make a drug often called fool’s hope or liquid courage. This drug grants temporary immunity to fear, but with the side effect of encouraging dangerous and foolhardy behavior; it’s strictly illegal in Sharn, due to the risk of users jumping off bridges.
