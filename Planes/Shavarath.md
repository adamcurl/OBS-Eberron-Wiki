# Shavarath: The Eternal Battleground

   In Shavarath, angels and devils are locked in endless conflict. Radiant blades spill burning blood, and bolts of force smash angels from the sky. In another layer, champions of justice ride armored dragons, assaulting a titanic airship. In yet another, steel krakens tear apart celestial frigates. There’s only one constant in Shavarath: war.


   Its primary combatants are immortal, and fallen soldiers return within a day or so. The forces are so evenly matched that a decisive victory is impossible. To outsiders, this war seems pointless. Over the last four hundred years of conflict in Nullius Terram, the Legion of Justice has advanced its front line by perhaps 20 feet. Mortals may look at this and ask, “Why continue to fight? If you fight for justice, why not help us?” 


   The angel isn’t fighting for a single nation, and this war isn’t driven by gold or politics. The immortals of Shavarath believe that their war is reflected across every reality. Justice. Tyranny. Cruelty. The war in Shavarath is a visible symbol of the balance of power between these forces, and when it shifts in Shavarath, the immortals believe it shifts everywhere. Fallen devils will be reborn. New airships will replace those destroyed. But every tiny victory—every demon defeated, every foot advanced in Nullius Terram—strengthens the forces of justice everywhere. Each angel knows they will never win a truly decisive victory, but as long as they fight, they can at least hold the line.


   Just as every mortal dreams in Dal Quor and has a shadow in Mabar, there’s a sliver of every mortal soul that fights in Shavarath. The skill and power of these conscripts reflect your own courage and will . . . and just like the angels, this sliver of yours can survive a thousand deaths. So it’s not your place to fight on the battlefields of Shavarath. You do your part by living your life, by fighting for the principles you believe in wherever you may be.

## Effects


*   **War Magic.** When a creature casts a spell that grants a bonus to AC, attack rolls, or saving throws, or a spell that grants temporary hit points, the duration is doubled. Spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.


*   **Unquenchable Fury.** A creature has advantage on saving throws against any spells or abilities that charm a target, as well as against the calm emotions and sanctuary spells. In addition, the duration of these effects are halved, to a minimum duration of 1 round. While a barbarian is raging, its rage can’t be ended early unless it’s knocked unconscious.

*   **Fight On.** On a creature’s turn, it can use a bonus action to spend 1 Hit Die. It rolls the die and adds its Constitution modifier, regaining hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1). Once a creature benefits from this property, it must finish a short or long rest before it can do so again.


*   **Bloodletting.** When a creature scores a critical hit with an attack that deals piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage, it can roll one of the attack’s damage dice one extra time and add it to the extra dice of the critical hit.

*   **Flexible Time. **Time’s passage varies between Shavarath’s layers. In many, time passes at the same rate as on the Material Plane; if you spend an hour fighting in the Burning Sky, an hour passes in Eberron. But other layers move at different speeds; you can spend a month in the trenches of Nullius Terram and find that less than three days have passed in Eberron. A creature with proficiency in Arcana can determine the passage of time in their layer by succeeding on a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

## Denizens


   All creatures in Shavarath are part of the war, whether they’re soldiers, tools, or victims. Those that fight are tied to legions, such as the Legion of Justice or the Legion of Tyranny. The immortals that fight in the war believe that each legion is governed by a higher power—simply called Command—and that these powers collectively shape the layers and determine the terms of battle. Immortals don’t question Command or wonder why things are the way they are. Immortals never deal directly with the Command of their legion, and they don’t even know if these powers have physical forms.


   Vast legions are broken into smaller cohorts (1,000), which are in turn divided into centuries of one hundred immortals, each representing an aspect of war like pain, mercy, or despair. A few special centuries and individual immortals can move between layers, but the majority are bound to their cohort and their layer. Immortals can be reassigned to new cohorts, and promoted or demoted—usually tied to a physical transformation. 


   An offensive’s primary goals often focus on destroying an important opponent. The Legion of Justice knows it can’t drive Tyranny from Nullius Terram, but defeating Lord Commander Astaralax is an important victory for the light, even though he’s an immortal and will eventually return. Sometimes an especially grand victory might cause an immortal to be “discharged”—when this happens, a new being of equivalent power takes its place, but it has a new personality, and the original spirit is eradicated. Such victories are worth even more points in the grand system that calculates the balance of power between the legions.



*   **Conscripts**

    *   Conscripts are the spiritual connection of every mortal on the Material Plane.  The strength of this sliver is determined by the mortal’s courage, willpower, and martial drive. Conscripts are manifestations, ideas conscripted to serve the purpose of the story. They appear to be sentient, but have no depth of personality or memory, can’t leave their layers, and can’t accomplish anything meaningful unless accompanied by a celestial or fiend. It’s only when the angel leads a charge that the conscripts of Nullius Terram matter, and though they inevitably die, they eventually reform. Conscripts can use the statistics of the creatures they appear to be, but may not have their full capabilities.



*   **Sword Wraiths**

    *   Sometimes, on the death of a great mortal warrior, echoes of their personality and martial spirit can coalesce into a sword wraith (though its abilities may vary based on the champion it echoes). Unlike standard conscripts, sword wraiths are capable of meaningful action even without the direction of an immortal and can command conscripts of their own. A sword wraith has the appearance of its mortal source and some of the memories, but it’s only an echo of the mortal. Sword wraiths reconcile their memories with the war within the layer. Karrn the Conqueror believes that he’s fighting for Karrnath and won’t be convinced otherwise.
    *   While sword wraiths generally form after a mortal’s death, the slivers of especially remarkable heroes can manifest sword wraiths even while alive. King Boranel of Breland surely has a sword wraith serving in the Legion of Justice.



*   **Whirling Blades**

    *   Shavarath’s whirling blades are enigmatic and deadly. These manifestations are swarms of animated weapons—knives, swords—that tear through the air, eviscerating anything unfortunate enough to be in their path. Sometimes they follow consistent paths like flocks of birds. Other times, they appear in a flash, lashing at victims, then vanishing. The whirling blades may be a defense mechanism designed to keep mortals from interfering with Shavarath, and the longer mortals remain in Shavarath, the more likely they are to be struck. These blade storms can also leak out into the Material Plane in areas of particularly brutal conflict, spilling blood on all sides.



*   **Angels**

    *   Most of Shavarath’s celestials serve the **Legion of Justice**, which embodies the concept of war fought for a just cause. Cohorts and their component centuries represent specific concepts within that broad ideal. Angels won’t conscript adventurers, but also won’t leave their duties to help them.
    *   The angels of Shavarath have a martial aspect, most appearing clad in armor, with their faces—and species—hidden behind full helms. Any sort of angel can be found in Shavarath, with its power reflecting its position. While the angels serve Justice Command, there are a few units also devoted to the Sovereigns. 
    *   While the Legion of Justice is the largest of the celestial legions, there are others that operate on a smaller scale. Most notable of these is the Legion of Freedom, reflecting the ideal of war fought to end oppression. They rarely field large armies and instead use swift strikes and guerrilla war; these angels embody the idea of champions who fight impossible odds for a noble cause, even if this forces them to follow ignoble paths.
    *   **The Century of Mercy **shows kindness to fallen foes.
    *   **The Century of the Innocent Guard **protects civilians—even if they’re just conscripts, the idea of civilians—and avoids collateral damage.
    *   **The Century of the Sun** asserts that Dol Arrah is Justice Command, and sword wraiths formed from paladins of Dol Arrah serve with this century.
    *   **Planetars **command centuries.
    *   **Solars and Empyrean **command cohorts.



*   **Demons**

    *   Demons represent the chaotic savagery of war. Most serve the **Legion of Cruelty**, and are wild, brutal, and far less disciplined than the devilish forces of Tyranny. They torture civilians, have no concern for collateral damage or their own losses, and make little effort to hold territory. Their focus is purely on inflicting maximum damage on foes and their own region alike. The Legion of Cruelty slaughters devils and angels with equal glee, and is despised by Justice and Tyranny alike. All manner of demons can be found in the Legion of Cruelty; their form reflects their military role, and many wear battered armor, steel scales, or are simply coated in fresh blood. 
    *   Some demons dedicate themselves and their unit to the Dark Six. Many within the Century of Terror wear the flayed skins of their foes and assert that the Mockery is part of Cruelty Command.
    *   **The Century of the Salted Earth **devastates the regions they fight in.
    *   **The Century of Terror **creates hideous displays with the corpses of their victims and delights in psychological warfare.
    *   **The Cohort of Bones **that uses undead conscripts in battle, commanded by a fiend with the stat block of Orcus.
    *   **Barlguras and hezrous** are brutal shock troops. 
    *   **Chasmes and vrocks** flood the skies
    *   **Goristros **are living siege weapons. 
    *   **Mariliths and balors **command centuries, while cohorts may be led by beings with the power of **demon princes**.



*   **Devils**

    *   Devils represent the disciplined practice of war in pursuit of oppression, and most serve the **Legion of Tyranny**. They seek to crush hope, and no form of treachery or dishonorable conduct is too low for a devil. However, they’re far more disciplined than the savage hordes of the Legion of Cruelty, working with precision and careful plans. 
    *   **The Century of Chains **forces enemy conscripts (and unlucky adventurers) to fight for them, and uses civilian conscripts as living shields. 
    *   **The Century of the Serpent **is always willing to negotiate and makes many pleasing offers, but any agreement inevitably leads to betrayal.
    *   **The Cohort of Misery **say that the Mockery is part of Tyranny Command, a belief that fuels a bitter enmity with the demons of the Century of Terror. 
    *   **The Cohort of the Iron Hand **maintains that the Sovereign Aureon leads Tyranny Command, and that they are simply enacting his vision for universal order.
    *   **Bearded and spined devils **serve as basic troops.
    *   **Erinyes **are elite squads that descend from the sky. 
    *   **Amnizu and balors **command centuries, and beings with the power of **archdevils **lead cohorts.



*   **Weapons of War**

    *   The battlefields of Shavarath contain engines of war unlike anything imagined on Eberron. Steel krakens, massive cannons, and immense monstrosities that serve as living battering rams scour the battlefield. However, even the grandest of these creations isn’t a product of industry or arcane science—these too are conscripts. The mighty cannon isn’t forged in some great foundry, but formed by the layer itself, because it’s part of the idea of this battle. Fernia is a plane of industry where an artificer might learn amazing techniques from the dao; by contrast, in Shavarath, an artificer might be inspired by what they see, but most of the greatest weapons can’t be replicated.


## Layers


*   **Nullius Terram**

    *   One of the largest layers, Nullius Terram is a battlefield the size of a small nation. It’s divided by several deep, heavily fortified trenches, which are separated by blasted regions of scorched earth, blast craters, and bones. Nullius Terram’s multiple trench lines twist and curve throughout the region, and in the lands between the trenches lie strategic outposts. The region is marked by constant barrages and terrible tools of mass destruction—widescale cloudkill, curses that transform conscripts into killers, and worse
    *   Tyranny, Cruelty, and Justice are the three active legions in this region. Justice has a difficult position in Nullius Terram, but has been slowly gaining strength. Periodically, the commanders send troops to clash in the fields between the lines, either in simple skirmishes or full offensives. Ultimately, the theme of this layer is that of slow, agonizing stalemate, and the suffering war can inflict on both the land and the soldiers. For every 10 minutes that pass in this layer, only 1 minute passes in Eberron.



*   **The Burning Sky**

    *   The sky is filled with many airships, some large enough to be floating towns. A few islands of rock float amongst the solid clouds, but if there’s any land below, it’s hidden by deadly fog. While there are skirmishes on the stone islands, most of the action occurs in the skies. Winged angels and fiends circle and duel, while conscripts guide dragons and other aerial mounts. 



*   **The City of Knives**

    *   It looks like this was once a city of marvels, with towers rivaling those of Sharn, gilded monuments, museums, gardens, and more. But the City of Knives lies between vast armies of the Legion of Justice and the Legion of Tyranny, and it represents the impact of brutal war on a glorious city. Ongoing bombardment is a constant threat. The civilian conscripts are fighting their own war for shelter and supplies; some rally together for the common good, while others have become looters and brigands. Justice and Tyranny hold their positions on either side of the city, relying on bombardment and occasional assaults. The Legion of Cruelty spreads terror within the city, while the celestials of the Legion of Freedom seek to rally the common people against all enemies.



*   **The Bloody Sea**

    *   There are no continents in this aquatic layer, but a handful of islands support the warring fleets. Grand and powerful warships clash in the open waters and bombard settlements. The ships may be familiar, but there are many other unusual engines of war: constructed krakens, submersible warships, monstrosities and dragons bound to service—wonders that the people of Eberron can imagine but can’t yet create. The pirate queen Lhazaar surely has inspired a sword wraith in the Bloody Sea . . . but which legion does her sword wraith fight for?



*   **The Warring Cities**

    *   At first glance, this layer looks like the blasted land between the trenches of Nullius Terram. It’s home to a number of warring cities, but they aren’t static settlements. Rather, some are floating fortresses that dwarf the Argonth of Breland, and others walk on two legs. The warforged colossus in Eberron: Rising from the Last War could be used as a model for a small fortress.


## Coterminous and Remote


   Shavarath is traditionally coterminous for 1 year every 36 years. Throughout history, some military leaders have plotted campaigns around this, while peaceful communities plan ahead to contain violence. In addition to its regular cycle, Shavarath frequently grows coterminous for a single day; predicting these periods was critical for battle strategy during the Last War. Shavarath is traditionally remote for a year every 36 years


   **Coterminous: **People are quick to anger and must be careful to not fight over trivial things. Angry words are more likely to produce brawls, and restless thought to lead to riots or revolutions. The plane’s War Magic and Unquenchable Fury properties spread worldwide while it’s coterminous, encouraging violence. Meanwhile, in Shavaran manifest zones, outbreaks of intense violence can draw whirling blades into the zone, slaughtering people on all sides.


   **Remote: **People are more peaceful and friendly towards each other.


## Valuable Items


*   **Armor, weapons, and tools of war **that can be the most powerful in the multiverse, but highly coveted by immortals in Shavarath.
